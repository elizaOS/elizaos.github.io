# Docusaurus Development Rules

## Development Server
- **Do NOT launch Docusaurus development server** during development sessions
- The user typically has Docusaurus running already and can see live changes
- File changes are automatically detected and hot-reloaded
- Focus on making file changes rather than testing server startup

## File Structure
- Custom CSS goes in `docs/src/css/custom.css`
- Configuration in `docs/docusaurus.config.ts`
- Content pages in `docs/docs/` directory
- Static assets in `docs/static/` directory

## Theme Customization
- Use CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for theme consistency
- Support both light and dark modes with `[data-theme="dark"]` selectors
- Match color scheme from main app `src/app/globals.css` when possible
- Prioritize readability and accessibility over visual flair
- Keep performance in mind - avoid heavy animations or complex effects

## Common Issues to Watch For
- Button text visibility in dark mode
- Contrast ratios for accessibility
- Mobile responsiveness
- Code block styling consistency
- Navigation element visibility

## Testing Approach
- Make incremental changes to CSS/config files
- User will verify changes in their running development server
- Focus on iterative improvements rather than wholesale rewrites
