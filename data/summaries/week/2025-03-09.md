# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Mar 9 - 15, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, the project took a major step forward in performance and stability by migrating its core runtime from Node.js to Bun. This foundational upgrade was complemented by significant enhancements to the user interface, making agent interactions more transparent and intuitive for developers and users.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

-   **Upgrading Our Core Engine for Speed and Stability**
    This foundational work improves performance across the entire platform and makes our system more reliable for future development.
    -   The core runtime environment was migrated from Node.js to Bun, boosting performance and improving the developer workflow in the [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) repository.
    -   We strengthened our database infrastructure to prevent data conflicts and ensure stability during critical operations like startup migrations.

-   **Enhancing Agent Interaction and Developer Experience**
    We are making it easier for users to understand what agents are doing in real-time and for developers to build on our platform.
    -   The user interface was improved to visually display agent actions and logs, providing clear insight into agent behavior in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
    -   Key voice interaction features (speech-to-text and text-to-speech) were restored in the client application, making agents more accessible.
    -   Our documentation was overhauled with clearer guides and video tutorials to improve the onboarding experience for new developers contributing to [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
The `eliza` repository focused on a significant infrastructure migration to Bun, alongside major improvements to the user interface and backend stability.

-   **Infrastructure & Performance:**
    -   Completed the migration from Node.js to Bun as the primary package manager and runtime, enhancing performance and developer experience ([#3945](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3945), [#3946](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3946)).
    -   Resolved WebSocket implementation issues to ensure stable real-time communication with the new Bun runtime in [#3924](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3924).
    -   Strengthened database stability by implementing package-scoped singleton connections ([#3933](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3933)) and fixing migration race conditions ([#3913](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3913), [#3888](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3888)).

-   **UI & User Experience:**
    -   Enhanced the UI to visualize agent actions and runtime logs, providing greater transparency into agent operations in [#3908](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3908).
    -   Fixed speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality in the GUI, restoring core interaction features in [#3939](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3939).
    -   Improved the chat window experience with several scrolling fixes ([#3925](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3925), [#3926](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3926)).

-   **Documentation & Code Quality:**
    -   Completed a major documentation cleanup, adding video embeds and improving navigation to enhance developer onboarding in [#3906](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3906).
    -   Introduced stronger types for improved code safety and maintainability in [#3931](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3931).
