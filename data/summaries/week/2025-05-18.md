# Overall Project Weekly Summary (May 18 - 24, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, ElizaOS took a major leap forward by significantly enhancing agent intelligence and user interaction. We introduced a powerful new knowledge system that allows agents to learn from PDF documents and rolled out comprehensive support for image and video chat, making the platform more capable and engaging for all users.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Making Agents Smarter and More Knowledgeable**
*To advance our goal of agent autonomy, we are giving agents more powerful ways to ingest and reason about external information.*
-   Our knowledge management system was refactored into a dedicated plugin, making it more modular and easier to extend in the future. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))
-   Agents can now learn directly from PDF documents, expanding their ability to work with diverse, real-world knowledge sources. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))
-   A new service registry was introduced, allowing plugins to communicate more effectively and paving the way for more complex, collaborative agent behaviors. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))

**Creating a Richer, More Interactive User Experience**
*We are focused on building an intuitive and powerful interface that allows users to collaborate with agents on complex, multi-modal tasks.*
-   Launched full support for images and video in chat, enabling agents to see, process, and discuss visual information for the first time. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))
-   Implemented real-time log streaming to give users instant feedback on agent activity, with a smart fallback system for improved reliability. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))
-   Improved the user interface for managing chat history and agent memory, making the platform easier to navigate and control. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))

**Strengthening the Foundation for Developers and Future Growth**
*A robust and scalable infrastructure is critical for supporting our growing community and enabling future innovation.*
-   Streamlined the developer workflow by improving how environment configurations are handled and enhancing the plugin publishing process. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))
-   Expanded our continuous integration pipeline to support mobile platforms, laying the groundwork for bringing ElizaOS to more devices. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))
-   Enhanced the core database and API systems to support new features like chat rooms and improve overall performance. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
This week, the core repository saw a major push to expand agent capabilities and improve the user experience, laying the groundwork for future V3 development.

**Major Features & Enhancements:**
-   Introduced a modular Knowledge Plugin to handle RAG functionality, separating it from the core runtime ([#4701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4701)).
-   Added support for processing PDF documents as knowledge sources for the RAG system ([#4611](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4611)).
-   Launched comprehensive image and video support in chat, enabling multi-modal interactions ([#4750](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4750)).
-   Implemented WebSocket-based log streaming for real-time feedback, with a fallback to API polling ([#4765](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4765)).
-   Added chat management features, allowing users to clear chats and delete individual messages ([#4659](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4659)).
-   Created a service registry pattern to allow typed communication between plugins ([#4719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4719)).

**Infrastructure & API:**
-   Improved the database API with support for batch operations and more efficient entity retrieval ([#4556](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4556)).
-   Unified environment file handling across all CLI commands for a more consistent developer experience ([#4686](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4686)).
-   Configured Tauri for multi-platform CI/CD, adding support for mobile builds ([#4699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4699)).
-   Added new API endpoints for creating and retrieving agent rooms ([#4647](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4647), [#4677](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4677)).

**Key Issues Resolved:**
-   Fixed issues with RAG document processing for large files ([#3745](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3745)).
-   Addressed agent hanging issues related to Anthropic and Twitter configurations ([#4486](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4486)).
-   Resolved platform interface concerns in the core package ([#3491](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3491)).
-   Updated documentation for community members and contributors ([#4260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4260), [#4285](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4285)).
