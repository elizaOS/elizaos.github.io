# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Feb 8 - 14, 2026)

This week, ElizaOS took a major leap toward becoming an enterprise-ready framework by introducing multi-language support for Rust and Python and overhaulng its security systems. We also significantly expanded our "plugin economy," adding new tools for financial safety, real-time sports data, and decentralized job marketplaces.

## Executive Summary
The project successfully transitioned toward a more versatile, multi-language architecture while hardening core security through a new global authentication system. By simultaneously expanding our library of financial and data plugins, we have made it easier for developers to build AI agents that can safely handle money, trade assets, and interact with the real world.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Expanding Language Support and Developer Reach**
*Goal: We want to invite more developers into our ecosystem by supporting the languages they already use.*
*   Announced next-generation support for **Rust and Python** alongside TypeScript in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), allowing a broader range of engineers to build on the framework ([#6485](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6485)).
*   Corrected installation guides in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama) to ensure a smoother setup process for new users ([#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/pull/15)).

**Hardening Security and Multi-User Safety**
*Goal: We are making the framework safe for professional and enterprise use cases where data privacy is critical.*
*   Launched a comprehensive **JWT authentication system** in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to better protect user data and isolate different agent sessions ([#6200](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6200)).
*   Redesigned how connections are handled in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp) to prevent data leaks between different users in shared environments ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/24)).

**Building a Robust Financial Infrastructure**
*Goal: We are giving agents the "guardrails" they need to manage money and trade securely on the blockchain.*
*   Added **transaction guardrails** and escrow services in [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) to ensure agents don't make unauthorized or unsafe financial moves ([#254](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/254), [#246](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/246)).
*   Overhauled the Ethereum (EVM) and Solana plugins to support more reliable connections and advanced trading features like "multicall" for faster execution ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/24), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/24)).

**Improving Performance and Reducing Costs**
*Goal: We want agents to be smarter and cheaper to run by reducing unnecessary work.*
*   Implemented a **media caching layer** in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) that remembers previous images and audio, saving users money on API fees ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/23)).
*   Introduced a new **Action Filter Service** in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) that stops "prompt bloat" by only sending the most relevant information to the AI ([#6475](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6475)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination
*   **Unified Blockchain Standards**: Multiple repositories, including [plugin-evm](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm) and [plugin-solana](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana), integrated with the **Spartan-Intel chain registry**. This ensures that all ElizaOS agents use the same standardized data when talking to different blockchains.
*   **Global API Resilience**: We implemented a shared "Cloud Proxy" strategy across the [Solana](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana) and [EVM](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm) plugins. This allows agents to stay online by automatically switching to backup data providers if their primary connection fails.

## Repository Spotlights
