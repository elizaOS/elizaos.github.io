# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Apr 20 - 26, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, the ElizaOS project focused on maturing the core framework by enhancing plugin capabilities, improving the overall user and developer experience, and increasing agent stability. These efforts make the platform more powerful for developers and more reliable for end-users, directly supporting our mission of building a modular and adaptable AI agent framework.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Expanding Agent Capabilities through a More Powerful Plugin System**
To support our goal of a modular and extensible framework, we are making it easier for developers to create more sophisticated and flexible plugins.
- Plugins can now use dynamic parameters in their routes, allowing for more complex interactions and capabilities in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
- We restored and documented logging capabilities with Cloudflare, giving developers better insight into their LLM usage in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
- A key issue with the Text-to-Speech (TTS) API was fixed to ensure it handles responses correctly, improving voice-enabled agent features in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).

**Improving the Developer and User Experience**
Making ElizaOS easier to use is crucial for community adoption and accelerating development.
- The command-line interface (CLI) now notifies developers about available upgrades, ensuring they can easily access the latest features and fixes from [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
- The user interface was refactored for better usability, and we introduced organization-level templates to help teams standardize their agent setups in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
- Configuration is now more flexible, with support for relative paths when loading agent character files in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).

**Increasing Core System Stability and Agent Reliability**
A robust and predictable platform is the foundation upon which all autonomous agents are built.
- Resolved a critical bug that caused agents to send repetitive replies in group chats, significantly improving the quality of multi-agent conversations in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
- Addressed errors in the agent lifecycle, including a fix for an "agent not found" error after creation and ensuring services stop correctly during unregistration in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
- Improved message formatting for agents communicating via Telegram by enhancing markdown parsing in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
This week's work focused on enhancing the core platform's plugin architecture, user experience, and agent stability. While significant progress was made, new issues highlighted challenges in Web3 plugin integrations that will require future attention.

**Key Updates:**
- **Plugin System:**
    - Added support for dynamic path parameters in plugin routes, enabling more flexible plugin creation ([#4335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4335)).
    - Restored and documented Cloudflare LLM logging and tracking for better observability ([#4354](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4354), [#4355](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4355)).
    - Fixed an issue with the Text-to-Speech (TTS) API to correctly handle stream responses ([#4352](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4352)).
- **User & Developer Experience:**
    - The CLI now notifies users of available version upgrades ([#4350](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4350)).
    - Introduced organization-based default agent templates to streamline setup for teams ([#4323](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4323)).
    - The main sidebar and UI components were refactored for improved usability ([#4353](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4353)).
    - Added documentation for deploying Eliza to a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) with Oasis ([#4334](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4334)).
- **Agent Stability & Bug Fixes:**
    - Fixed a bug causing repetitive agent replies in group chat scenarios ([#4331](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4331)).
    - Resolved an "agent not found" error that occurred after creating an agent through the GUI ([#4337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4337)).
    - Improved the agent unregistration process to ensure associated services are stopped correctly ([#4360](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4360)).
- **New Issues & Challenges:**
    - Identified several challenges with Web3 plugin integrations, including installation failures for the Solana plugin ([#4342](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4342)) and functionality issues with the EVM plugin ([#4368](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4368)).
