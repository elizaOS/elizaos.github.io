# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, the team focused on strengthening the project's foundations by modernizing the core `eliza` framework for significantly better performance and stability. This foundational work was complemented by the expansion of our plugin ecosystem and strategic planning for future capabilities, including automated agent testing and more efficient agent-to-agent communication.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Modernizing the Core Framework for Performance and Stability**
To ensure ElizaOS is fast, reliable, and easy for developers to build upon, we invested heavily in upgrading our core technology and improving the developer experience.
-   The framework's core event system was migrated from Node.js's `EventEmitter` to Bun's native `EventTarget` API, a major step that improves performance and solidifies our commitment to the modern Bun runtime ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   The Command Line Interface (CLI) was made more robust by fixing critical bugs related to project creation and plugin loading, creating a smoother workflow for developers ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   A new `plugin-quick-starter` template was introduced to simplify the creation of backend-only plugins, accelerating development for our community ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).

**Expanding the Plugin Ecosystem**
To increase the capabilities of AI agents, we continue to integrate them with a wider range of external tools and services.
-   The official plugin registry was expanded with the addition of the `plugin-mattermost` for team collaboration and the `plugin-bonsai`, making new tools available to all ElizaOS agents ([elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)).

**Planning for Future Growth and Scalability**
We are laying the architectural groundwork to support more complex agent interactions and a larger, more collaborative development ecosystem.
-   The project's reporting and UI architecture was overhauled to support multiple repositories, a critical step toward managing the entire ElizaOS ecosystem as a unified whole ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).
-   Work began on scoping a new **Scenario Runner** feature, which will enable automated testing and evaluation of agent performance, a key capability for measuring progress ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

This week highlighted strong collaboration across the project to tackle complex, foundational challenges that impact multiple components.
-   **Improving Agent Communication:** A detailed proposal for direct, synchronous agent-to-agent communication was discussed across several repositories ([elizaos/eliza#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584), [elizaos.github.io#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584)). This initiative aims to replace inefficient polling mechanisms with a modern, OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, making multi-agent systems faster and more responsive.
-   **Solving Plugin Data Migrations:** Contributors collaborated to diagnose a critical bug preventing custom plugin database schemas from migrating correctly ([elizaos/eliza#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588), [elizaos.github.io#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588)). This coordinated effort led to a deep analysis of the root cause and the proposal of several workarounds while a permanent fix is developed.
-   **Troubleshooting Twitter Integration:** Persistent issues with the Twitter plugin, including API rate limits and initialization errors, drew feedback from numerous community members across the `plugin-twitter`, `registry`, and `elizaos.github.io` repositories. This shared effort is crucial for diagnosing and resolving a blocker that affects autonomous agent operations.

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
The core framework saw significant modernization and stabilization work.
