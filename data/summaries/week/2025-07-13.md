# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, the project focused on strengthening the core framework's stability and developer experience while simultaneously laying the architectural groundwork for future capabilities like direct agent-to-agent communication. While the plugin ecosystem expanded with new integrations, resolving persistent issues with the Twitter plugin emerged as a top community priority, highlighting the challenges of relying on external APIs.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Strengthening the Core Framework for Developers**
*Goal: To make the platform more stable, performant, and easier for developers to build on, ensuring a reliable foundation for agent development.*
-   The core APIs were modernized by migrating to Bun's native EventTarget, boosting performance and future-proofing the system in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
-   The developer experience was significantly improved by fixing numerous bugs in the command-line interface (CLI) and build process, leading to a more predictable and efficient workflow in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
-   A new backend-only plugin template was introduced to streamline the creation of new integrations for the framework in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).

**Architecting for a More Scalable and Capable Future**
*Goal: To lay the foundational groundwork for more complex agent interactions and larger, multi-part projects.*
-   Major progress was made on a system to support projects that span multiple repositories, with architectural updates to both the backend summarization engine and the frontend in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io).
-   A detailed plan for a new "Scenario Runner" was created, which will provide a sandboxed environment for testing and evaluating agent behavior in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
-   A comprehensive testing framework was established for the query system, improving the reliability and correctness of our data processing pipelines in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io).

**Expanding and Supporting the Plugin Ecosystem**
*Goal: To increase the framework's utility by adding new integrations and actively supporting the health of existing ones.*
-   The plugin ecosystem grew with the addition of new plugins for Mattermost and Bonsai, expanding the tools available to agent builders in [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).
-   Significant community effort was focused on diagnosing persistent issues with the Twitter plugin, confirming that API rate limits and database errors are major blockers for users on free-tier plans. This triage occurred across [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry), and [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Designing Direct Agent-to-Agent Communication**
A key architectural initiative this week involved designing a system for agents to communicate with each other directly and synchronously. This effort, discussed across issues in `elizaos/eliza`, `elizaos.github.io`, and `elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter`, resulted in a comprehensive proposal for a new OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. The goal is to eliminate inefficient polling and enable more sophisticated, real-time collaboration between agents, a foundational step towards more complex multi-agent systems.

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
Work in the core repository was centered on improving stability, developer experience, and modernizing internal APIs.
-   **CLI and Build Fixes:** Resolved critical bugs where the `elizaos start` command failed to build the project ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504)), the dev server did not shut down gracefully ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562)), and plugin actions failed to load from published packages ([#5624](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5624)).
-   **API Modernization:** Completed a significant migration from Node.js EventEmitter to the more performant, native Bun EventTarget API ([#5609](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5609)), improving type safety and future compatibility.
-   **Architectural Planning:** Laid out a detailed plan for a new Scenario Runner for sandboxed agent testing ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573) - [#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579)) and developed a comprehensive proposal for direct agent-to-agent communication ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584)).
-   **New Features:** Introduced a new backend-only plugin template to simplify development ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589)) and a standardized service type system to improve modularity ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)).

### elizaos/elizaos.github.io
This repository focused on major architectural enhancements to support project scalability and code quality.
-   **Multi-Repository Support:** Implemented a backend summarization feature ([#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142)) and overhauled the frontend architecture ([#143](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/143)) to enable support for projects spanning multiple repositories.
-   **Improved Code Reliability:** Established a comprehensive testing framework for queries, adding extensive coverage to ensure data processing is correct and reliable ([#144](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/144)).
-   **Technical Debt Reduction:** Streamlined the codebase by removing outdated scripts and historical data ([#145](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/145)).

### elizaos-plugins/registry
The plugin registry expanded its offerings while also serving as a hub for troubleshooting existing integrations.
-   **New Plugins:** Added the `plugin-mattermost` for integration with the Mattermost messaging platform ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)) and published the `plugin-bonsai` ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191)).
-   **Community Troubleshooting:** Discussions highlighted that Twitter API rate limits ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38)) are a significant blocker for free-tier users. A root cause for a custom plugin callback bug ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947)) was also further investigated by the community.

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter
While no code was merged, this repository was a focal point for diagnosing critical bugs and discussing core architectural solutions.
-   **Issue Triage:** A recurring database error related to inserting into the `memories` table was identified as a key blocker, with a new issue opened ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/39)) and multiple user reports on an existing one ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31)).
-   **Architectural Analysis:** The repository's issues served as a platform for in-depth analysis of framework-wide challenges, including proposals for direct agent-to-agent communication ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584)) and fixes for custom plugin schema migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588)).
