# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, the ElizaOS project balanced immediate progress with long-term strategic planning. We enhanced the framework's capabilities in the Web3 space and improved developer tooling, all while laying the groundwork for a major architectural evolution designed to increase the system's scalability and robustness.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Expanding Agent Capabilities in Web2 and Web3**
*Strategic Importance: To fulfill our mission, agents must be able to interact with a growing number of external systems and services, reflecting our commitment to modularity and open collaboration.*
-   The framework's Web3 capabilities were significantly enhanced by adding support for optional calldata in EVM transfers, allowing for more complex and powerful on-chain transactions in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm).
-   Our plugin ecosystem grew with the addition of a new community-contributed plugin (`@standujar/plugin-composio`), demonstrating the success of our open, modular architecture in the [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).

**Improving Developer Experience and System Stability**
*Strategic Importance: A smooth and reliable development environment empowers our community to build, test, and innovate more effectively.*
-   System observability was improved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) through enhanced Sentry integrations and logging, making it easier for developers to debug and maintain the core platform.
-   Key developer workflow issues were resolved across multiple plugins, including fixing CI test failures and containerizing the project starter, which simplifies setup and ensures code quality.
-   The agent's actions are now more transparent, with UI enhancements in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm) and [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge) that display action calls and results directly in the chat interface.

**Planning for a More Scalable and Modular Future**
*Strategic Importance: We are proactively redesigning core components to ensure the framework can support future growth, complexity, and our vision for decentralized intelligence.*
-   A major strategic planning initiative was launched in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), resulting in a comprehensive set of issues that outline a roadmap for refactoring the core API and message bus.
-   Discussions around integrating new AI providers like Venice AI reinforced our commitment to modularity, with a preference for leveraging existing plugins over adding redundant native support.

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Shared Developer Infrastructure Improvements**
*Initiative: To streamline the development and testing process across multiple plugins by improving shared tooling and UI components.*
-   Work was completed to containerize the project starter ([#5842](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5842)), fix CI test failures ([#5714](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5714)), and enhance UI visibility ([#5831](https://github.comcom/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5831)). This coordinated effort benefits developers working on both the `plugin-evm` and `plugin-knowledge` repositories, ensuring a more consistent and reliable development experience.

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
-   **Strategic Planning:** Kicked off a major initiative to evolve the platform's architecture by creating a comprehensive roadmap to refactor the core API and message bus.
-   **Observability & Debugging:** Enhanced system stability and debugging capabilities by improving Sentry integrations, client-side sourcemaps, and overall logging.
-   **Core Functionality:** Implemented a new backend system for tracking agent runs and resolved several critical bugs in the core and client packages.

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm
-   **Feature Enhancement:** Merged a significant improvement to allow an optional `data` parameter in EVM transfers, greatly increasing the flexibility of Web3 interactions ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/16)).
-   **Maintenance:** Performed a routine dependency update and bumped the version to 1.0.13 to ensure stability and security ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/22)).
-   **Developer Experience:** Resolved several key issues, including fixing failing CLI tests ([#5714](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5714)), dockerizing the project starter ([#5842](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5842)), and improving UI visibility of agent actions ([#5831](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5831)).

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge
-   **UI Improvements:** A fix was proposed to resolve a loading issue in the knowledge panel, aiming to improve UI stability ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/39)).
-   **Tooling & DX:** Closed several issues to improve the developer workflow, including the successful dockerization of the `project-starter` ([#5842](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5842)) and confirmation of working CLI CI tests ([#5714](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5714)).
-   **User Transparency:** Completed work to display agent action calls and their results directly in the chat UI, making agent behavior easier to understand ([#5831](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5831)).

### elizaos-plugins/registry
-   **Ecosystem Growth:** Expanded the agent framework's capabilities by integrating a new community-contributed plugin, `@standujar/plugin-composio`, into the official registry ([#217](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/217)).
