# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Apr 13 - 19, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, ElizaOS made significant strides in making the agent framework more accessible for new users and more capable for advanced ones. We launched a new interactive onboarding experience to improve usability while simultaneously expanding agent abilities with key upgrades to our Twitter and Telegram plugins, reinforcing our commitment to both user experience and agent autonomy.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

-   **Improving the New User Experience**
    *Strategic Importance: To lower the barrier to entry for new developers and users, making it easier for them to get started and contribute to the ecosystem.*
    -   An interactive onboarding tour was launched to guide new users through the platform's core features in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
    -   The user interface was made safer and more intuitive by adding confirmation dialogs for destructive actions and a "Stop Agent" button for better control in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).

-   **Expanding Agent Capabilities and Awareness**
    *Strategic Importance: To make our AI agents more powerful, adaptable, and human-like in their interactions across different platforms.*
    -   The Twitter plugin was upgraded to support long-form tweets and delete posts, giving agents more control over their social media presence in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
    -   Agents can now signal a "typing" indicator in Telegram, creating more natural and human-like conversational experiences in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
    -   A foundational "world provider" was introduced, giving agents basic contextual awareness of their environment, a key step towards more autonomous behavior in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).

-   **Strengthening Core Framework Stability and Reliability**
    *Strategic Importance: To ensure the platform is robust, scalable, and provides a stable foundation for community and internal development.*
    -   A comprehensive new test suite was developed for our command-line tools, enabling us to catch bugs earlier and ensure reliability in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
    -   A critical memory leak related to knowledge processing was resolved, significantly improving system stability and performance in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
    -   Core framework compatibility was broadened by implementing a custom UUID generator, ensuring ElizaOS runs smoothly across a wider range of browsers in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
