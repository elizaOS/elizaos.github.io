# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Feb 16 - 22, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, ElizaOS significantly advanced its modular framework by enhancing the plugin ecosystem for developers and expanding support for new AI models. Key efforts focused on improving agent management and strengthening integrations with platforms like Discord and Twitter, making our agents more powerful and accessible.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Growing the Plugin Ecosystem**
*Strategic Importance: To empower developers to easily build, discover, and share new capabilities for ElizaOS agents, accelerating community-driven innovation.*
- A new plugin showcase page was launched in our documentation, making it easy for users to find and filter community-built plugins ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- We resolved key issues with the plugin registry, ensuring a smoother installation experience for developers adding new tools to their agents ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).

**Expanding AI and Web3 Capabilities**
*Strategic Importance: To provide users with more choices for intelligence and to integrate more deeply with decentralized technologies, aligning with our core philosophy.*
- We expanded our AI model support by integrating new providers, including Secret AI and NEAR AI, offering more flexibility in agent creation ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- A default voice option from ElevenLabs was added, improving the built-in voice generation capabilities of our agents ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- To strengthen our Web3 foundation, we set Lava as the default RPC provider for NEAR and Starknet, improving reliable access to these decentralized networks ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).

**Improving Agent Management and Reliability**
*Strategic Importance: To make agents easier for users to control and to ensure they operate reliably on external social platforms.*
- We introduced new command-line tools and upgraded character management to be database-driven, giving users more robust control over their agents ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- Comprehensive automated tests were added for Discord, Twitter, and Telegram integrations, allowing us to catch bugs before they impact users and ensure stable performance ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- A security vulnerability was patched, and retrieval performance for our knowledge systems (RAG) was improved, making the platform more secure and efficient ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
