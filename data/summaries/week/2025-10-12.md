# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, development focused on making the ElizaOS framework faster and more powerful for developers. We completed a major overhaul of our deployment system for quicker builds and simplified our core API based on community feedback, while also expanding the platform's capabilities with new support for PDF documents and Web3 integrations.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Improving Developer Experience and Performance**
*This initiative focuses on making our framework faster, more stable, and more intuitive for developers to build with, accelerating our path to community-driven progress.*
- The command-line deployment system was overhauled for faster, more resource-efficient builds in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
- The core API was simplified with a new `generateText()` function, directly addressing a community request to make text generation more straightforward in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
- The build process for the Anthropic plugin was stabilized by fixing a critical compilation error, ensuring a reliable development environment for contributors in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic).

**Expanding AI and Web3 Capabilities**
*This work broadens the range of tasks and ecosystems our AI agents can operate in, moving us closer to our goal of a universally adaptable framework.*
- Initial support for processing PDF documents was introduced in the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge) repository, allowing agents to extract information from a new data source.
- We began integrating the Moralis v2 plugin into the [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry), enhancing our framework's ability to interact with Web3 data and services.
- Deployments to Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) were simplified through a new wrapper in the [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) CLI, making it easier to run agents in secure, verifiable contexts.

**Strengthening Our Architectural Foundation**
*This initiative ensures the long-term health and scalability of our codebase, aligning with our core philosophy of modularity and composability.*
- The [elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) repository's core structure was significantly refactored into modular components that are easier to maintain and extend.
- The Eigencloud proof-of-concept was formally concluded in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), marking the completion of a key research initiative into deterministic LLM inference.

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Ensuring Ecosystem Health**
*To maintain the quality and usability of resources that span the entire project, we rely on community feedback and coordinated action.*
- After a community member reported that all plugin links in our documentation were broken ([elizaos/eliza#6061](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6061)), the team quickly applied a fix to the documentation repository, restoring critical navigation for our users.

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
- Overhauled the CLI's deployment system, migrating to a bootstrapper architecture for faster deployments and lower resource usage ([#6058](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6058)).
- Implemented a new `generateText()` API to provide a simpler, Promise-based method for text generation in response to community feedback ([#6062](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6062)).
- Added a new Eigen TEE wrapper to the CLI to streamline deployments to Trusted Execution Environments ([#6065](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6065)).
- Closed the issue tracking the Eigencloud POC ([#5768](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5768)), formally concluding the exploration of a deterministic OpenAI-compliant inference endpoint.
- Resolved a community-reported issue where all plugin links in the documentation were broken ([#6061](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6061)).
- A new issue was opened to track the integration of the `n1n.ai` API as a new model provider, signaling future expansion of multimodal capabilities ([#6064](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6064)).

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic
- Completed a major architectural refactor, reorganizing the codebase into a modular structure with `models`, `providers`, and `utils` directories to improve scalability ([#9](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/9)).
- Fixed a critical build failure by adding `@types/node` and updating `tsconfig.json`, resolving TypeScript compilation errors and stabilizing the development environment ([#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/10)).

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge
- Opened a pull request to introduce PDF handling capabilities, allowing the plugin to process PDF documents via the `KNOWLEDGE_ALLOW_PDF` environment variable ([#42](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/42)).

### elizaos-plugins/registry
- A pull request was opened to add the `@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2` plugin, expanding the registry's support for Web3 ecosystems ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).
