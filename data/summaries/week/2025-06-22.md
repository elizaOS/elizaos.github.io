# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, ElizaOS made significant strides in maturing its core infrastructure to support future growth and scalability. The team successfully modernized the main application's API client for enhanced stability and overhauled the project's data pipelines to provide a unified view of contributions across the entire ecosystem. This foundational work was complemented by the expansion of available agent plugins and a strong focus on resolving critical bugs to improve the current user and developer experience.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Modernizing the Core Platform for Scalability and Stability**
*This initiative focuses on strengthening our foundational technology to ensure the project is reliable, secure, and ready for future expansion.*
-   The core application's API was significantly upgraded by migrating to a new, type-safe client package. This major effort in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) makes the platform more stable and easier for developers to build upon.
-   Our contributor data system was completely overhauled to track activity across all project repositories, not just one. This work in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io) gives us a holistic view of community engagement and project health.

**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem and Capabilities**
*Our goal is to empower users by broadening the range of tasks agents can perform and increasing their flexibility.*
-   The ecosystem grew with the addition of the Bonsai plugin and new proposals for Mattermost, TokenMetrics, and Polkadot integrations in the [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).
-   Work in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) explored a major architectural shift to allow plugins to be configured per-agent, a key step toward more modular and customizable agents.
-   Planning began in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster) to move from a polling system to more efficient webhooks, a change that would improve performance across multiple plugins.

**Improving Reliability and the Developer Experience**
*We are committed to making our platform easier to use and more reliable by actively responding to community feedback and fixing bugs.*
-   Critical file upload bugs were resolved in both the main [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) application and the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge), restoring important functionality for users.
-   The command-line interface (CLI) was made more user-friendly and stable in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
-   Across multiple repositories, active community discussions on improving documentation, simplifying deployment, and fixing custom plugin issues highlighted a strong feedback loop that is driving near-term priorities.

### Cross-Repository Coordination

This week highlighted how interconnected the ElizaOS ecosystem is, with several initiatives requiring collaboration across different parts of the project.

-   **Unified Contributor Tracking:** The most significant coordinated effort was the overhaul of the data pipeline in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io). This work was specifically designed to aggregate data from all other ElizaOS repositories, creating a single, comprehensive view of project-wide contributions for the first time.
-   **Shared Problem-Solving:** Community members and maintainers collaborated across repositories to diagnose system-wide issues. Discussions on improving documentation ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5234)), challenges with custom plugin development ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5260)), and core architectural decisions like user identity management ([#105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/105)) took place in parallel across `eliza`, `plugin-knowledge`, `registry`, and `elizaos.github.io`, ensuring solutions will benefit the entire platform.

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
-   Successfully migrated the client to a new, type-safe `@elizaos/api-client` package ([#5240](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5240), [#5263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5263)), a major undertaking that improves stability and the developer experience.
-   A significant architectural change was introduced to make plugins agent-scoped, giving developers more granular control. The change was later rolled back ([#5297](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5297)) to resolve dependency issues, demonstrating an iterative approach to complex features.
-   Resolved a critical file upload bug by migrating the feature to `multer` ([#5252](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5252)), restoring a key piece of user functionality.
-   The CLI was improved with a more user-friendly interface for environment variables ([#5291](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5291)) and better cross-platform stability ([#5250](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5250)).
-   Fixed several UI bugs, including one that caused the chat to get stuck on "agent is thinking" ([#5274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5274]).

### elizaos/elizaos.github.io
-   Completed a major overhaul of the contributor data pipeline to aggregate scores and summaries from multiple repositories ([#137](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/137)), enabling a holistic view of the entire ElizaOS ecosystem.
-   Optimized data ingestion by implementing batched GraphQL requests ([#134](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/134)), making the process significantly faster and more resilient to rate limiting.
-   Fixed a critical bug in the deployment workflow that was preventing deployments from triggering correctly ([#136](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/136)).
-   Resolved a key operational issue by migrating the fetching of wallet addresses into the main data pipelines ([#130](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/130)).

### elizaos-plugins/registry
-   Expanded the plugin ecosystem by adding `plugin-bonsai` to the registry ([#181](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/181)).
-   Received new community proposals to add plugins for Mattermost ([#183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/183)), TokenMetrics ([#182](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/182)), and Polkadot ([#180](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/180)).
-   Helped resolve a critical agent response failure ("No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING") by clarifying that the agent's character file required the `openai` plugin ([#5279](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5279)).
-   Advanced architectural discussions on using internal GitHub IDs for user identity ([#105](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/105)) and enabling webhook support for plugins ([#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6)).

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge
-   Fixed a critical bug that caused "Unexpected end of form" errors during file uploads ([#25](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/25)), improving the reliability of knowledge ingestion.
-   Enhanced data integrity by implementing deterministic IDs to prevent duplicate documents from being created ([#27](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/27)).
-   Community discussions highlighted key developer pain points, including challenges with project setup ([#5249](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5249)) and custom plugin development ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5260)), providing valuable feedback for future improvements.

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter
-   Activity focused on diagnosing user-reported issues. A key authentication problem was traced to an outdated dependency ([#28](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/28)).
-   A new critical bug was reported where the plugin fails to reply to mentions, despite being configured correctly ([#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/29)).
-   A comprehensive analysis of "API endpoint not found" errors concluded the cause is likely environmental or configuration-related, not a code defect, helping focus debugging efforts ([#5230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5230)).

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster
-   While no code was merged, a strategic discussion was initiated to explore webhook integration as an alternative to the current polling mechanism ([#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6)). This change would improve efficiency and user experience.
