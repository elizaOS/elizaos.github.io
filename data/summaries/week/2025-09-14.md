# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, the ElizaOS project shifted its focus toward enhancing platform stability and performance. A major architectural overhaul in the Farcaster plugin addressed a critical performance issue, while the core framework received numerous fixes to improve reliability and the developer experience across different operating systems. This concerted effort to resolve bugs and strengthen foundational systems marks a significant push to mature the platform.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Improving Platform Performance and Stability**
*To ensure the framework is reliable, scalable, and cost-effective, we focused on resolving performance bottlenecks and hardening core systems.*
- The Farcaster plugin was re-architected to use webhooks instead of constant polling, directly addressing a major performance issue that caused over 2 million database requests in just five days. This work was completed in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster).
- The core framework's command-line tools were made more robust, with specific fixes to ensure they work correctly on Windows and in complex repository setups. This work was done in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
- A significant new initiative was proposed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to undertake a full cleanup of the core build system, aiming to remove technical debt and create a cleaner, more universal foundation for future development.

**Enhancing the User and Developer Experience**
*To make the platform more intuitive and effective, we prioritized fixes and features that directly impact how people interact with ElizaOS.*
- The Knowledge plugin was updated with an in-app PDF viewer, allowing users to view documents with zoom controls directly within the interface without needing to download files. This was part of the work in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge).
- A persistent bug that incorrectly prompted users on stable channels about updates for alpha software versions was fixed in the [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) framework.
- Several smaller but impactful bugs were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), including one that prevented images from displaying correctly and another that caused new projects to fail during setup.

**Growing the Plugin Ecosystem**
*To expand the capabilities of ElizaOS agents, we continue to add new tools and integrations to the ecosystem.*
- The new `plugin-octav` was added to the official [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry), making it available for all users to install and use.

### Cross-Repository Coordination

- **Resolving a System-Wide Update Notification Bug:** A community-reported issue ([#5971](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5971)) causing incorrect update prompts was discussed across multiple repositories. The fix was implemented in the core `elizaos/eliza` framework ([#5980](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5980)), resolving the problem for all plugins and users.
- **Diagnosing a Persistent Plugin Error:** Users and maintainers are collaborating across the `elizaos/eliza` and `registry` repositories to troubleshoot a significant database error affecting the Twitter plugin ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/39)), demonstrating a community-wide effort to solve tough bugs.

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
- **CLI and Build Stability:** Significant effort was invested in hardening the framework. This included fixing Windows-specific CI tests ([#5982](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5982), [#5981](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5981)), improving the build process ([#5985](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5985)), and refining the dev server detection logic ([#5979](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5979)).
- **Update Checker Fixed:** A bug causing users on stable channels to receive notifications for alpha versions ([#5971](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5971)) was resolved ([#5980](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5980)).
- **Plugin and Template Fixes:** Several user-facing bugs were addressed, including fixing image display for the OpenRouter plugin ([#5890](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5890)), adding a missing dependency to the SQL plugin ([#5977](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5977)), and updating starter templates to prevent compilation failures ([#5975](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5975)).
- **Core Refactor Proposed:** A major technical initiative was created to clean up the `/core` package, aiming for a pure JS/TS build validated across multiple environments ([#5976](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5976)).
- **Project Wrap-up:** Preparations for the ETH Tokyo Workshop were officially completed ([#5955](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5955)).

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster
- **Major Architectural Refactor:** The plugin was overhauled to support webhooks as an alternative to polling, fundamentally improving real-time responsiveness and reducing operational costs ([#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/11)).
- **Performance Bottleneck Identified:** The refactor was prompted by a new issue reporting an excessive number of database requests (over 2 million in 5 days), highlighting a critical performance concern ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/8)).
- **Build and Dependency Updates:** A critical build error was resolved ([#9](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/9)), and the SDK was updated to maintain compatibility ([#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/10)).

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge
- **Enhanced User Experience:** A dual bug-fix and feature release improved the knowledge panel. A critical loading bug was resolved, and a new in-app PDF viewer with zoom/reset controls was added, all within a single pull request ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/39)).

### elizaos-plugins/registry
- **Ecosystem Expansion:** The new `plugin-octav` was added to the plugin index, making it available to the community ([#230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/230)).
- **Active Community Troubleshooting:** Community members and maintainers engaged in active discussions to diagnose several key issues, including a persistent SQL error with the Twitter plugin ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/39)), the discoverability of Web UI documentation ([#5857](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5857)), and the logic for alpha version update notifications ([#5971](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5971)).
