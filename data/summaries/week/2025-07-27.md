# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week was focused on strengthening the project's foundations to accelerate future development. We enhanced the developer experience by standardizing our testing framework and clearing a significant backlog of documentation and plugin issues. This internal housekeeping was complemented by growing external recognition and proactive work to improve our plugin deployment infrastructure.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Enhancing Developer Experience and Project Consistency**
*Strategic Importance: A consistent and smooth development process allows our team to build features faster and with higher quality.*
-   The entire project was standardized on a single testing framework, `bun:test`, to ensure uniformity and simplify maintenance across all packages in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
-   We improved the quality of our developer-facing resources by completing a comprehensive documentation review and closing out several video production tasks in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
-   Issues with the plugin development workflow and deployment pipelines were identified to reduce friction for contributors, with work beginning in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) and [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge).

**Strengthening Plugin Infrastructure and Stability**
*Strategic Importance: Robust and flexible plugins are central to our modular AI agent framework, enabling diverse capabilities.*
-   A key bug was fixed in the knowledge plugin, allowing it to correctly load knowledge from different character configurations and increasing its adaptability in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge).
-   A backlog of maintenance issues for several Web3 plugins was cleared, ensuring they remain functional and up-to-date within the core [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) repository.

**Growing Community Visibility**
*Strategic Importance: External recognition helps attract new contributors and validates the quality and relevance of our work within the AI ecosystem.*
-   The project was featured in the "Awesome Claude Code" list, a significant acknowledgment that highlights our growing relevance in the broader AI development community, as tracked in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Standardizing Plugin Deployment**
*Goal: To ensure all plugins, especially those recently migrated, can be deployed automatically and reliably across the ecosystem.*
-   A critical issue regarding missing deployment configurations was identified in the `plugin-knowledge` repository and is being tracked in the core `eliza` repository ([#5691](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5691)). This cross-repository effort has already sparked collaboration to create a unified solution for all version 1.x plugins, ensuring consistent delivery.

## Repository Spotlights
