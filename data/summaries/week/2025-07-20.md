# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, the ElizaOS project focused on strengthening the core framework's reliability and security while simultaneously expanding the agent ecosystem into new Web3 domains. Significant progress was made in hardening key plugins and refactoring core components for better performance, complemented by a surge in community contributions and a strategic push to improve documentation for developers and users.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Strengthening Core Framework Reliability and Security**
*Strategic Importance: Ensuring the platform is robust, secure, and dependable is fundamental to building trust and enabling complex, autonomous agent operations.*
-   The core framework was updated to use XML-based prompts, a change designed to improve the reliability of responses from Large Language Models ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   Critical security vulnerabilities were patched in the `plugin-training` module to prevent command injection, safeguarding the model training process ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   Several bugs were fixed in the command-line interface (CLI) and core configuration packages, improving the stability and developer experience across the platform ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).

**Expanding the Web3 Plugin Ecosystem**
*Strategic Importance: Growing our library of plugins, especially in Web3, is key to our mission of creating versatile AI agents that can operate across both traditional and decentralized ecosystems.*
-   The registry was expanded with a new plugin for the COTI blockchain, enabling agents to perform private transactions ([elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)).
-   A significant number of new feature requests were submitted for DeFi plugins, including Aave, Morpho, and Defi-Llama, signaling strong community interest in expanding ElizaOS's financial capabilities ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).

**Improving Developer and User Onboarding**
*Strategic Importance: Making our project easier to understand and contribute to is essential for attracting new developers and fostering a vibrant, collaborative community.*
-   A major initiative was launched to overhaul project documentation, including plans for comprehensive introductory videos and guides ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   New quick-start guides were added to help developers build agents more efficiently ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   Documentation for the Solana plugin was significantly updated to improve clarity for new users and contributors ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana)).
-   Developer automation was enhanced with a new, more flexible GitHub Action for generating project summaries, streamlining internal workflows ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Coordinated User Support for Agent Failures**
*A user-reported issue with an unresponsive agent using the Google API required a coordinated diagnostic effort across multiple project areas to successfully resolve.*
-   The issue was tracked across the [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry), and [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io) repositories.
-   Collaboration between maintainers and the user identified the root cause as a misconfigured API key. The successful resolution ([#5664](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5664)) not only restored functionality for the user but also provided valuable troubleshooting information for the wider community.

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
The core repository saw major advancements in framework reliability, security, and usability, alongside a clear roadmap for future work defined by community requests.
-   **Framework Reliability:** All JSON-based prompts were refactored to an XML format to improve the consistency of LLM interactions ([#5623](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5623)).
-   **Security Hardening:** The `plugin-training` module was secured against command injection vulnerabilities by validating model parameters and fixing prompt escaping ([#5663](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5663), [#5661](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5661)).
-   **Bug Fixes:** Key bugs were resolved, including an incorrect file export in the `@elizaos/config` package ([#5635](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5635)) and a CLI issue where the database was created in the wrong directory ([#5616](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/issues/5616)).
-   **Documentation & Onboarding:** A new `AGENT.md` quick reference guide was added ([#5669](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5669)), and a major effort was kicked off to create new video tutorials and review all documentation ([#5665](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5665)-[#5668](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5668)).
-   **Future Work:** A suite of issues was opened to create new DeFi plugins for Aave, Morpho, Clanker, and Defi-Llama, outlining future expansion into Web3 finance ([#5643](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5643)-[#5647](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5647)).

### elizaos-plugins/registry
The plugin registry grew this week, demonstrating healthy community engagement and expanding the capabilities available to ElizaOS agents.
-   **New Plugin Added:** The `plugin-coti` was merged, enabling agents to interact with the COTI blockchain for private transactions ([#193](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/193)).
-   **New Plugin Submitted:** A pull request for a new `plugin-my` was opened, indicating continued community contribution ([#192](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/192)).
