# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

This week, ElizaOS took a major leap forward in building a more scalable and developer-friendly framework. We unified our core messaging system to streamline agent communication and implemented true multi-tenancy, laying the critical groundwork for supporting a larger, more diverse ecosystem of users and applications. These foundational improvements were complemented by a strong focus on community engagement, with new features designed to recognize contributors and make it easier for new developers to join and build.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Building a More Powerful and Scalable Core Framework**
To support our vision of a widely adopted, extensible AI framework, we focused on strengthening the core architecture for security, scalability, and ease of integration.
-   A new **Unified Messaging API** was introduced in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), creating a single, standard way for all parts of the system to communicate and simplifying future development ([#6095](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6095)).
-   We launched a new **Jobs API** to allow external systems to interact with agents for single, stateless tasks, expanding the platform's integration capabilities ([#6097](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6097)).
-   The platform now supports secure **multi-tenancy** through PostgreSQL Row-Level Security, a critical feature that allows multiple isolated servers to run on a single database, paving the way for robust cloud services ([#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101)).

**Investing in Community and Developer Experience**
We believe a thriving community is essential for long-term success, and this week we rolled out several initiatives to foster growth and make development easier.
-   A new **contributor badge and achievement system** was launched in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io) to recognize and reward community contributions ([#161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/161)).
-   To improve community access, a more prominent link to our **Discord server** was added to the documentation site in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs) ([#78](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/78)).
-   New technical guides for **x402 payment integration and Nginx deployment** are being added to [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs), giving developers the instructions they need for advanced setups ([#77](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/77)).

**Improving Plugin Modularity and Reliability**
In line with our philosophy of modular design, we made significant improvements to the architecture and stability of our plugins.
-   The OpenAI plugin underwent a major refactoring in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai), breaking down a large, complex file into a modular structure that is easier to maintain and extend ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/19)).
-   A critical race condition in the Solana plugin was resolved in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana), making the wallet service more reliable during startup ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/18)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Standardizing Agent Communication Across the Ecosystem**
A significant, coordinated effort was made to modernize how agents and services communicate.
-   The core framework team in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) designed and implemented a new unified messaging API ([#6095](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6095)). In parallel, the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana) team began planning for its adoption by opening an issue ([#6096](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6096)) to track the integration work. This coordinated effort ensures that as the core framework evolves, the surrounding plugin ecosystem evolves with it, maintaining architectural consistency across the project.

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
-   Implemented a **Unified Messaging API** (`elizaOS.sendMessage()`) to standardize communication and reduce code duplication across all clients ([#6095](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6095)).
-   Introduced a new **Jobs API** for stateless, one-off agent interactions, complete with supporting payment middleware ([#6097](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6097), [#6098](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6098), [#6099](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6099)).
-   Enabled secure **multi-tenancy with PostgreSQL Row-Level Security**, allowing multiple ElizaOS servers to share a single database securely ([#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101)).
-   Added a new `elizaos login` command to the CLI to support **cloud authentication** ([#6100](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6100)).
-   Resolved a critical bug where `.env` variables were being ignored, ensuring correct configuration loading ([#6102](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6102)).

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai
-   Completed a major **architectural refactoring** by breaking down a 1,253-line `index.ts` file into a modular structure, improving long-term maintainability ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/19)).
