# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Aug 17 - 23, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, ElizaOS delivered a major new capability for agent evaluation with the completion of the Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System. This powerful tool allows us to rigorously test agent performance across diverse scenarios, a key step toward our goal of building more autonomous AI. Alongside this milestone, the team enhanced core platform stability and initiated research into next-generation Web3 features.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Delivering a Powerful New Framework for Agent Evaluation**
To build truly autonomous agents, we need robust tools to measure and compare their performance systematically. This new framework is a critical piece of infrastructure for data-driven development and improvement.
-   A comprehensive new CLI tool was launched in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to automate the testing of agents across many different configurations, enabling complex, repeatable experiments.
-   A dynamic reporting system was developed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) that generates detailed performance reports in both HTML and PDF formats, providing clear, shareable insights into agent behavior.

**Enhancing Core Platform Stability and Developer Experience**
A stable and reliable foundation is essential for building complex AI systems and ensuring a smooth developer workflow.
-   Critical database errors and test failures were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), improving the overall reliability of our platform and our continuous integration pipeline.
-   Several bugs in the command-line interface were fixed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), making it more reliable for developers to publish and test their work.

**Pioneering Next-Generation Features for Performance and Decentralization**
We are actively exploring and building the next wave of features that push the boundaries of agent capabilities and align with our Web3 vision.
-   Research was initiated into integrating on-chain attestations, a key step toward verifiable, decentralized agent interactions, tracked in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io).
-   Development began on a new Sessions API to better manage user interactions and a system for asynchronous processing to improve performance in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Scenario Matrix Runner Initiative**
-   **Goal:** To deliver a unified, project-wide system for testing and evaluating AI agents.
-   **Result:** This week saw the successful conclusion of this major initiative. The core feature development was completed in the [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) repository, while the overarching epic tracking this work was formally closed in both [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) and [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry), demonstrating tight coordination to deliver a complete, end-to-end solution.

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
This repository was the center of development activity, delivering a major new feature set while also improving stability and beginning work on future capabilities.
-   **Completed the Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System**, a powerful new evaluation framework. This massive effort involved closing over a dozen related issues, including the main epic ([#5781](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5781)), matrix execution ([#5778](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5778)-[#5780](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5780)), run orchestration ([#5782](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5782)), data collection ([#5783](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5783)-[#5786](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5786)), and the reporting dashboard ([#5787](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5787)-[#5790](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5790)).
-   **Enhanced CLI reliability** by fixing a publisher module bug ([#5796](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5796]) and resolving issues with the TEE starter command ([#5773](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5773)).
-   **Improved platform stability** by fixing a critical database error ([#5791](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5791]) and resolving multiple CI test failures ([#5792](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5792]).
-   **Initiated development on new features**, including a Sessions API for better user session management ([#5799](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5799]) and a system for asynchronous embedding generation to boost performance ([#5793](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5793)).

### elizaos-plugins/registry
Activity in this repository marked the formal conclusion of a major, cross-project initiative.
-   The "Epic: Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System" ([#5781](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5781)) was officially closed, signifying the successful completion of this large-scale feature from a plugin perspective.

### elizaos/elizaos.github.io
This repository focused on strategic planning for future Web3 capabilities.
-   A new research issue was opened to investigate the **integration of on-chain attestations** ([#150](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/150)), aligning with the project's core philosophy of decentralization.
