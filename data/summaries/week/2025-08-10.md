# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Aug 10 - 16, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, ElizaOS made significant strides in maturing its agent evaluation capabilities and expanding its reach into both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems. A major push to formalize performance benchmarking was initiated, while the core platform was enhanced with an OpenAI-compatible API and new blockchain tools, demonstrating a dual focus on long-term maturity and immediate capability expansion.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Formalizing Agent Performance and Evaluation**
*To build truly autonomous agents, we must be able to rigorously measure their performance, cost, and consistency.*
- A major set of advanced scenario testing features was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), enabling more sophisticated validation of agent behavior with natural language and dynamic tools ([#5727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5727), [#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725), [#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5726)).
- A comprehensive new evaluation framework was proposed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a formal benchmark suite, with plans to measure token usage, execution time, cost, and consistency ([#5758](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5758), [#5757](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5757), [#5759](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5759), [#5760](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5760)).

**Expanding Agent Capabilities into Web2 and Web3**
*Our mission is to create an AI framework that thrives across diverse digital ecosystems, from traditional web services to decentralized networks.*
- The core platform in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was upgraded to include an OpenAI-compatible API, making it easier for developers to integrate ElizaOS with existing tools and workflows ([#5753](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5753)).
- A new EVM plugin was added to [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), giving agents the ability to interact with Ethereum-compatible blockchains and wallets ([#5752](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5752)).
- The plugin ecosystem continues to grow, with three new plugins integrated into the [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) and two more proposed by the community ([#197](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/197), [#201](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/201), [#200](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/200)).

**Strengthening the Developer Ecosystem and Platform Stability**
*A thriving open-source project depends on a stable platform and a positive experience for our community of developers.*
- A critical bug preventing developers from successfully publishing new plugins is being actively addressed through a coordinated effort between the community and core maintainers ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754)).
- A key stability fix was merged in the [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) to improve how the system handles plugin compatibility, preventing potential crashes ([#199](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/199)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

- **Advanced Scenario Testing Framework**: A significant initiative to improve agent testing was completed. Core features for natural language interaction, dynamic plugin loading, and advanced mocking were developed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#5727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5727), [#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725), [#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5726)) and are now being leveraged by the [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) to enable more sophisticated validation of community plugins.

- **Diagnosing a Critical Publishing Bug**: A high-priority issue where the command-line tool falsely reports success on a failed plugin publish ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754)) saw collaborative triage. Community members in the [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) provided detailed analysis, while a fix is now underway in the [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) repository, demonstrating a healthy, project-wide response to a shared problem.

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
- **Core Infrastructure**: Introduced a Hono server to provide an OpenAI-compatible API, significantly improving interoperability ([#5753](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5753)). The API was also updated to expose intermediate tool calls for better visibility ([#5755](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5755)).
- **New Capabilities**: Integrated a new EVM plugin, adding foundational wallet and blockchain tooling for Web3 interactions ([#5752](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5752)).
- **Testing & Evaluation**: Completed a major feature set for advanced scenario testing, including natural language interaction ([#5727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5727)), dynamic plugin loading ([#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725)), and advanced mocking ([#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5726)). A new suite of evaluators for performance, cost, and consistency was also proposed ([#5757](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5757), [#5759](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5759), [#5760](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5760)).
- **Bug Fixes & DX**: Actively addressing a critical bug where the CLI fails to report publishing errors ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754)). Standardized import paths to improve code consistency ([#5751](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5751)).

### elizaos-plugins/registry
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Expanded the registry by integrating three new plugins (`@elizaos/plugin-clanker`, `@elizaos/plugin-defillama`, and another) and enhancing plugin discovery with more repository metadata ([#197](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/197), [#198](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/198)).
- **New Proposals**: The community proposed two new plugins for integration: `plugin-fal-ai` ([#201](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/201)) and `plugin-asd123` ([#200](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/200)).
- **Stability and Triage**: Merged a critical bug fix to correct v1 compatibility detection and prevent crashes in the registry generation script ([#199](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/199)). Community members provided key analysis for a critical publishing failure affecting plugin developers ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754)).
