# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Feb 23 - 1, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, ElizaOS executed a major architectural evolution, rebuilding core components to support more scalable and sophisticated AI agents. We introduced multi-tenancy and a new "worlds" concept for agent management, laying a more robust and flexible foundation for the framework's future growth in both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Building a More Scalable and Flexible Foundation**
To support a growing number of agents and more complex use cases, we are re-architecting the core platform for greater modularity and scale, directly aligning with our core philosophy.
- The database architecture was overhauled to support multi-tenancy, allowing different users or organizations to manage their agents in isolated environments ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- We modernized our data layer to support lightweight, in-browser databases, making the platform more adaptable and easier to deploy in various environments ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- Key architectural goals were achieved to standardize how the system handles different AI models and internal messaging, simplifying future development and integration ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).

**Enhancing Agent Autonomy and Management**
To advance our goal of creating increasingly autonomous systems, we are equipping agents with more sophisticated capabilities for managing their identity, environment, and relationships.
- We introduced the concept of "worlds," which allows agents to operate within distinct server environments with defined roles and ownership rules ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- A new "rolodex" feature was implemented, enabling agents to manage contacts and relationships, a crucial step toward more complex social behaviors ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- The user experience for creating and managing agent characters was streamlined through a new, consolidated interface ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).

**Expanding Ecosystem Integrations and Developer Experience**
To foster a thriving open-source community, we are making it easier for developers to build with, and extend, the ElizaOS framework across different platforms.
- Our Web3 capabilities were expanded with new support for the Viction provider and improved multi-chain handling for EVM-compatible blockchains ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- The plugin system was improved with better error handling, and the Local AI plugin was refactored to support a wider range of models ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- We significantly upgraded our documentation with new blog posts, showcase examples, and guides to help developers get started and contribute more effectively ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
The core repository saw foundational changes to its architecture, agent management systems, and plugin infrastructure, setting the stage for future capabilities.

- **Architecture and Database:**
  - Implemented multi-tenancy support by splitting the `users` table into `agents` and `entities`, creating a more flexible foundation for agent management ([elizaos/eliza#3637](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3637)).
  - Added PGLite support with a redesigned database layer using an injectable connection manager, enhancing modularity ([elizaos/eliza#3598](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3598)).
  - Completed Model Context Protocol (MCP) support for standardized context management across different models ([elizaos/eliza#844](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/844)).
  - Unified the system architecture by making all packages plugins, which reduces overrides and simplifies the codebase ([elizaos/eliza#1063](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/1063)).

- **Agent and Character Management:**
  - Introduced the concept of "worlds" to represent servers or collections of entities, adding roles and ownership state to the core ([elizaos/eliza#3682](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3682)).
  - Consolidated character/agent handling with new, unified views for creating, editing, and listing characters ([elizaos/eliza#3708](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3708)).
  - Implemented a "rolodex" feature, allowing entities to have components for contact information and relationship management ([elizaos/eliza#3725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3725)).

- **Plugin and Integration Enhancements:**
  - Added support for the Viction provider, expanding our Web3 integrations ([elizaos/eliza#3701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3701)).
  - Improved EVM multi-chain handling to enhance user experience when interacting with different blockchains ([elizaos/eliza#644](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/644)).
  - Refactored the Local AI plugin to run on R1 models from Deepseek and added managers for Studio LM and Ollama ([elizaos/eliza#3663](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3663)).

- **Documentation and UI:**
  - Updated documentation with new blog posts, showcase examples, and a changelog with RSS support ([elizaos/eliza#3729](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3729)).
  - Added comprehensive, LLM-suitable project documentation to better support developers and AI-powered assistance ([elizaos/eliza#936](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/936)).
