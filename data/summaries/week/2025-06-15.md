# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, ElizaOS made significant strides on two key fronts: expanding the platform's AI capabilities and hardening the core framework for greater stability. We integrated new AI models like Ollama and Gemini, launched a dedicated AWS Bedrock plugin, and resolved several critical, long-standing bugs affecting plugin reliability. This work enhances the framework's power and modularity while providing a more stable foundation for developers.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Expanding AI Capabilities and Plugin Choices**
*Goal: To give developers more power and flexibility by supporting a wider range of AI models and community tools, making our framework adaptable to more use cases.*
-   Integrated support for Ollama and Google Gemini directly into the core framework, broadening the choice of local and cloud-based AI providers for users ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   Launched a new, dedicated plugin for AWS Bedrock in response to community requests, providing a clean, modular solution for leveraging Amazon's AI services ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   Added powerful new features for knowledge management, including a vector search UI and support for custom LLM providers, enhancing agents' data processing abilities ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge)).
-   Grew the plugin ecosystem with four new community-contributed plugins added to the official registry, expanding the tools available to all ElizaOS agents ([elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)).

**Strengthening Core Stability and Developer Experience**
*Goal: To ensure the framework is reliable, robust, and easy for our community to build upon, which is essential for long-term growth and adoption.*
-   Began a major overhaul of the testing infrastructure with a migration to `bun:test`, aiming to improve the speed, consistency, and reliability of our development cycle ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   Improved the framework's modularity by separating the server into its own standalone `@elizaos/server` package, allowing it to be used independently and streamlining core development ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   Enhanced the project's data infrastructure to support multiple repositories and standardize wallet address formats, preparing our analytics and user profiles for future growth ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).
-   Resolved a critical bug that caused infinite recursion in the JSON sanitizer and addressed several issues to improve compatibility for developers on Windows ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

-   **Coordinated Bug Resolution:** A critical, long-standing bug ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5017)) that prevented plugin actions from correctly reporting back to the user chat was impacting multiple plugins like `plugin-evm`. This week, a fix was implemented in the core `elizaos/eliza` framework and confirmed resolved by the community, restoring essential functionality across the entire plugin ecosystem.
-   **Responsive Feature Delivery:** A community request for AWS Bedrock support ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5117)), tracked across several repositories, was addressed by the core team. A dedicated `plugin-bedrock` was released, providing a clean, modular solution that immediately meets developer needs.

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
The core framework saw a major push to expand AI provider support while simultaneously hardening the architecture and testing suite.
-   **AI Provider Expansion:** Added native support for Ollama ([#5160](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5160)) and Google Generative AI (Gemini) ([#5217](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5217)) to the `create` command and released a dedicated plugin for AWS Bedrock ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5117)).
-   **Architectural Refinements:** The server was extracted into a new, independent `@elizaos/server` package to improve modularity and enable standalone use ([#5122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5122)).
-   **Testing Overhaul:** Began a strategic migration from `vitest` to `bun:test` to standardize and accelerate testing, starting with the CLI package ([#5199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5199)).
-   **Critical Bug Fixes:** Resolved an infinite recursion bug by adding circular reference detection to the JSON sanitizer ([#5152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5152)) and fixed key bugs affecting project loading ([#5156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5156)) and plugin imports ([#5163](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5163)) on Windows.
-   **Developer Experience:** Added a feature to clear agent memories for better state control ([#5187](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5187)) and improved `create` command speed by lazy loading dependencies ([#5214](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5214)).

### elizaos-plugins/registry
The plugin registry grew significantly and saw the resolution of several important, long-standing issues affecting the entire ecosystem.
-   **Ecosystem Growth:** Added four new plugins to the registry: `plugin-coconut` ([#175](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/175)), `plugin-jellie` ([#177](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/177)), `plugin-jello` ([#176](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/176)), and the "kudo" plugin ([#179](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/179)).
-   **Stability Improvements:** Confirmed and closed several critical bugs, including the plugin callback failure ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5017)), issues with Knowledge Management (RAG) ([#5004](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5004)), and API failures ([#4940](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4940), [#4955](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4955)).
-   **Future Development:** A new feature request to allow customizable root loggers for downstream projects sparked immediate, detailed planning ([#5183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5183)).

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm
While no new code was merged, this week was productive for stabilization, with the closure of several critical user-facing bugs.
-   **Issue Resolution:** A critical bug preventing plugin action callbacks from reaching the user chat was confirmed fixed in version 1.0.9, restoring essential transaction feedback ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5017)).
-   **Community Engagement:** A new issue was opened to inquire about token swap capabilities, signaling community interest in expanding the plugin's DeFi functionality ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/20)).

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster
Work focused on improving code clarity and resolving key integration issues to better align with the Farcaster ecosystem.
-   **Code Refinement:** A significant refactoring effort was completed to replace the generic term "post" with Farcaster's native term "cast" throughout the codebase, improving consistency and documentation ([#3](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/3), [#4](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/4), [#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/5)).
-   **Bug Fixes:** Resolved a key bug that prevented `.env` file settings for 'post' and 'dryrun' from being correctly applied ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/1)).

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge
This plugin received major feature enhancements and critical bug fixes, significantly expanding its capabilities.
-   **Feature Enhancements:** Merged a major feature to allow the use of custom LLM providers for document processing ([#13](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/13)) and added a new vector search capability to the UI ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/23)).
-   **Data Integrity:** Resolved a bug that caused non-unique Knowledge/Memory IDs, ensuring reliable data storage ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/17)), and corrected an invalid regular expression for base64 validation ([#18](https://github.comcom
