# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, the ElizaOS project made significant strides on two parallel fronts: dramatically expanding the platform's AI capabilities and undertaking a major effort to harden the core framework. We integrated new AI models from Ollama and Google, launched a dedicated AWS Bedrock plugin, and grew our plugin ecosystem, while simultaneously overhauling our testing infrastructure and resolving critical stability bugs to build a more robust and reliable foundation for future growth.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Expanding AI Capabilities and the Plugin Ecosystem**
*Our goal is to create a versatile and extensible framework, and this week we significantly broadened the tools and models available to developers.*
-   The core framework now directly supports **Ollama** and **Google's Gemini models**, giving users more choice and flexibility in their AI agent setups ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   A new, dedicated plugin for **AWS Bedrock** was released, fulfilling a key community request for integration with Amazon's generative AI services ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   The **Knowledge Plugin** was enhanced with a new vector search UI and the ability to use custom LLM providers for document processing, expanding its data retrieval power ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge)).
-   The plugin ecosystem continued to grow with the addition of **four new community-contributed plugins** to the official registry ([elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)).

**Strengthening the Core Framework for Stability and Reliability**
*To support our growing ecosystem, we are focused on making the underlying platform more modular, scalable, and bug-free.*
-   The server was extracted into its own independent package, a key architectural change that improves modularity and allows it to be used standalone ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   We began a strategic overhaul of our testing infrastructure by migrating to `bun:test`, aiming to standardize and accelerate our validation processes ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   The project's central data pipeline was refactored to support multiple repositories, a crucial step for scaling our ability to track contributions across the entire organization ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).
-   A critical, long-standing bug that prevented plugin actions from communicating back to the user chat was resolved, restoring essential functionality for many plugins ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).

**Improving the Developer and User Experience**
*We are committed to making ElizaOS easier and more intuitive to use for both developers building on the platform and end-users interacting with agents.*
-   The command-line interface was improved by speeding up project creation and consolidating commands for a more consistent workflow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   Key bugs affecting developers on Windows were fixed, improving cross-platform compatibility ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   User profiles on our community site now display a verification checkmark for linked wallets, improving trust and recognition ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).
-   We responded quickly to a community request for more flexible logging, with a detailed implementation plan already in progress to give developers more control ([elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Resolving the Critical Plugin Callback Bug**
A major collaborative success this week was the resolution of a bug ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5017)) where plugins could perform actions but couldn't report the results back to the user. This issue was reported by users of `plugin-evm` and other plugins, diagnosed by maintainers, fixed within the core `elizaos/eliza` repository, and verified by the community. This single fix restored critical functionality across the entire plugin ecosystem, demonstrating the interconnected nature of our framework.

**Coordinated Response to Feature Requests**
The integration of AWS Bedrock ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5117)) and the new request for a customizable logger ([#5183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5183)) highlight our process for addressing community needs. Discussions that began in the context of one plugin were recognized as project-wide needs. The Bedrock request resulted in a new, dedicated plugin from the core team, while the logger request is being centrally planned to benefit all downstream projects, ensuring a consistent and powerful solution for everyone.
