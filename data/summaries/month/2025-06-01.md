# Overall Project Monthly Summary (June 2025)

## Executive Summary
June was a month of foundational transformation for ElizaOS, focused on maturing our core architecture for greater modularity and scalability. This strategic refactoring was paired with significant ecosystem growth, including the integration of new major AI providers and an expansion of our community-driven plugin library, enhancing the platform's power and flexibility for all users.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Architecting for Scalability and Modularity**
*This initiative focuses on restructuring our core framework to support future growth, making it more flexible, maintainable, and easier for developers to build upon.*
-   The core server was separated into its own standalone package in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), a major architectural step that allows for more flexible deployments and independent development ([#5122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5122)).
-   The plugin system was redesigned to be agent-specific instead of project-wide, giving developers granular control over the tools and capabilities of each individual agent ([elizaos/eliza#5270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5270)).
-   We built a new multi-repository data pipeline in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io) to aggregate and analyze contributor activity across the entire ElizaOS organization, laying the groundwork for enhanced project insights and community recognition ([#137](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/137)).

**Expanding the AI and Plugin Ecosystem**
*Our goal is to provide users with maximum choice and capability by integrating a wide range of AI models and community-built tools.*
-   Support for several new AI model providers was added to the core framework, including Google Generative AI (Gemini), Ollama for local models, and OpenRouter, significantly broadening the range of intelligence available to agents ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   The plugin ecosystem grew substantially with the addition of eight new community-submitted plugins to the [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry), adding new capabilities in areas like DeFi and messaging.
-   The Knowledge plugin was enhanced with UI-based vector search and support for custom LLM providers, making it easier for users to build and interact with specialized knowledge bases ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge)).

**Enhancing Platform Stability and Developer Experience**
*This work is critical for making ElizaOS a reliable and user-friendly platform for developers to build on and for end-users to interact with.*
-   A critical, long-standing bug preventing plugin action callbacks from reaching the user was resolved, a major stability improvement that positively impacts numerous plugins like `plugin-evm` and `plugin-knowledge` ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5017)).
-   The entire testing framework in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was overhauled and unified, improving our ability to catch bugs and ensure cross-platform compatibility, especially for Windows ([#5185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5185)).
-   The command-line interface (CLI) was modernized with a better user interface, and new setup guides were created to improve the onboarding experience for new developers ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

This month featured significant collaboration across the project to address foundational issues and align on architectural strategy.

-   **Resolving Critical Bugs:** The fix for the plugin callback failure ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5017)) required coordination between the core `eliza` team and plugin maintainers. The issue was reported across multiple plugin repositories (`plugin-evm`, `plugin-knowledge`, `plugin-farcaster`), and its resolution was a shared victory that stabilized the entire plugin ecosystem.
-   **Architectural Alignment:** The request to add AWS Bedrock support, discussed in multiple plugin issue trackers, resulted in a strategic decision to create a new, dedicated `plugin-bedrock`. This modular approach, rather than adding the functionality to an existing plugin, reinforces our core philosophy and was communicated across repositories like `plugin-evm` ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5117)) and `plugin-farcaster` ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5117)).
-   **Centralized Data Infrastructure:** The new data pipeline built in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io) was designed from the ground up to ingest data from all other ElizaOS repositories. This initiative required a holistic view of the organization and sets the stage for future cross-project reporting and a contributor badge system ([#139](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/139), [#140](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/140)).
