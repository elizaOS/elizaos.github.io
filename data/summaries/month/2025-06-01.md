# Overall Project Monthly Summary (June 2025)

## Executive Summary
June was a month of foundational transformation for ElizaOS, as we re-architected our core framework for greater modularity and simultaneously expanded our AI and plugin ecosystem. This strategic work enhances our platform's flexibility and scalability while delivering immediate new capabilities to developers and users, reinforcing our commitment to building a composable, open-source AI agent framework.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Architecting for a Modular, Composable Future**
*This initiative is central to our philosophy, enabling us to build a more flexible, scalable, and maintainable framework where components can be developed and improved independently.*
-   The core server was separated into its own standalone package (`@elizaos/server`), and the plugin system was redesigned to be agent-scoped, allowing for more granular customization and independent development ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   We built a new multi-repository data pipeline to track contributions and activity across the entire ElizaOS organization, laying the groundwork for enhanced project analytics and community recognition ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).
-   Strategic discussions in multiple repositories led to the decision to support new AI models like AWS Bedrock via dedicated plugins, reinforcing our modular approach over monolithic integrations ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster)).

**Expanding AI Capabilities and the Plugin Ecosystem**
*Our goal is to empower agents with a diverse range of tools and intelligence sources, making them more powerful and adaptable across Web2 and Web3 ecosystems.*
-   We broadened the framework's intelligence by integrating support for new AI model providers, including Google Generative AI (Gemini), Ollama, and OpenRouter ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   The plugin ecosystem saw significant growth with the addition of eight new community-developed plugins, expanding agent capabilities in areas like social media and token metrics ([elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)).
-   Knowledge management was enhanced with new features like UI-based vector search and support for custom LLM providers, making it easier for agents to process and retrieve information ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge)).

**Enhancing Platform Stability and Developer Experience**
*To foster a thriving community, we are focused on making the framework reliable, performant, and easy for developers to build with.*
-   We resolved a critical, cross-platform bug that prevented plugin action callbacks from reaching users, a major stability improvement that was validated across multiple plugins ([elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)).
-   The developer workflow was significantly improved by overhauling the entire testing framework to a unified standard and modernizing the CLI with a better user interface ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
-   Numerous bugs related to data integrity, file handling, CI/CD pipelines, and cross-platform compatibility were fixed, creating a more stable foundation for development ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

-   **Resolving the Plugin Callback Bug:** A critical bug where agent actions weren't reported back to the user ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5017)) was a major focus. The issue was tracked in the `registry` and `elizaos.github.io` repositories, with the fix validated by community members using plugins like `plugin-evm` and `plugin-knowledge`. This coordinated effort significantly improved the reliability of the entire plugin ecosystem.
-   **Architecting for a Multi-Repository Ecosystem:** The development of a new data pipeline in `elizaos/elizaos.github.io` was a strategic initiative to create a holistic view of the entire ElizaOS organization. This work was informed by architectural discussions in `elizaos-plugins/registry` around long-term user identity management ([#105](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/105)), demonstrating a project-wide shift toward scalable, cross-repository systems.
