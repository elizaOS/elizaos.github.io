# Overall Project Monthly Summary (September 2025)

## Executive Summary
September was a pivotal month focused on future-proofing our architecture and expanding our capabilities. A major strategic initiative to redesign the Eliza CLI was launched across the project to improve modularity and scalability. This foundational work was complemented by a significant surge in the growth of our plugin ecosystem, reinforcing our commitment to building an extensible and robust AI agent framework.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Future-Proofing the Core Architecture**
To support long-term growth and maintainability, we began a strategic overhaul of our core components to make them more modular and scalable.
-   A project-wide discussion was initiated to refactor the Eliza CLI ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5860)), with the goal of simplifying its role and delegating more complex logic to the server and individual projects. This effort was a major focus in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry), and [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp).

**Accelerating Plugin Ecosystem Growth**
We are focused on empowering agents with a diverse set of tools, which requires a vibrant and reliable plugin ecosystem.
-   The plugin ecosystem saw a dramatic expansion with proposals for over a dozen new plugins, including tools for Sourcegraph, Composio, and more, submitted to the [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).
-   We improved the reliability of the plugin system by fixing a critical bug in version compatibility detection, ensuring the registry correctly handles different plugin versions ([#214](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/214)) in [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).

**Strengthening Platform Stability and Developer Experience**
To make ElizaOS a more reliable and welcoming platform for contributors, we invested in our core infrastructure and development tools.
-   The release process was standardized with unified NPM release workflows ([#5877](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5877)) in the main [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) repository, making our release management more predictable.
-   A persistent bug preventing agents from generating images in Discord was resolved ([#5861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5861)), restoring a key feature for users.
-   Several stability improvements were made, including fixes for logger compatibility in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp) ([#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/15)) and the main [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) repository ([#5849](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5849)).

**Enhancing Agent Testing and User Interaction**
We delivered new features to improve how developers test agents and how users interact with them.
-   Agent testing capabilities were significantly enhanced by adding support for dynamic, multi-turn conversations in test scenarios ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)) in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
-   The user experience was improved with a new standalone CLI chat interface ([#5879](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5879)) and real-time feedback for tool actions in the web UI ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

-   **Eliza CLI Refactoring Initiative:** The month's most significant coordinated effort was the architectural planning for the Eliza CLI overhaul ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5860)). This discussion spanned the `eliza`, `registry`, and `plugin-mcp` repositories, ensuring that changes to this core component are considered from all angles of the project, from the core framework to the plugin ecosystem.
-   **Resolving User-Facing Bugs:** The resolution of the image generation bug in Discord ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809)) demonstrated effective cross-repo collaboration. The issue was tracked in the `registry` and `eliza` repositories, with the final fix implemented in `eliza` ([#5861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5861)), showcasing how different parts of the project work together to solve a single user-facing problem.
