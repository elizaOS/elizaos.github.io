# Overall Project Monthly Summary (February 2025)

## Executive Summary
February was a transformative month for ElizaOS, focused on foundational architectural improvements that significantly advance our mission. We overhauled the core framework to be more modular, extensible, and scalable, preparing the platform for more complex, multi-agent ecosystems.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Strengthening the Core Framework for Modularity and Growth**
*Strategic Importance: To support our vision of a composable and extensible AI, we re-architected core systems to make them more flexible and easier for developers to build upon.*
- A new dynamic plugin system was implemented, allowing developers to add capabilities without modifying the core codebase and improving overall extensibility ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- The database architecture was overhauled to better support multi-tenancy, separating agents from users to enable more complex, multi-agent environments ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- Agent and character management was consolidated, providing a more unified and robust system for defining and controlling AI agent roles and ownership ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).

**Expanding Agent Capabilities in Web2 and Web3**
*Strategic Importance: To increase the utility and autonomy of our agents, we expanded their ability to interact with a wider range of external services, from social media to decentralized finance.*
- New plugins were added to connect agents to Web3 services like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, Desk Exchange, and Edwin, enabling crypto data analysis and DeFi operations ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- Integrations with social media platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and Discord were enhanced, giving agents more sophisticated ways to post content and interact with communities ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- Support for new AI model providers was added, including NEAR AI, Secret AI, and ElevenLabs, broadening the range of intelligence and voice synthesis options available to agents ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).

**Improving Performance and Developer Experience**
*Strategic Importance: We invested in our underlying infrastructure and documentation to make the platform faster for agents and easier for our community to contribute to.*
- The project's package manager was switched to Bun, resulting in significantly faster dependency installation and script execution for developers ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- Key documentation was created and improved, including a new remote deployment guide and clearer contribution guidelines, lowering the barrier for new contributors ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).
- Comprehensive test suites were added for critical integrations like OpenAI, Anthropic, and SQLite, improving the reliability and stability of the platform ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
February saw major foundational work in the main ElizaOS repository, focusing on modularity, database architecture, and expanding integrations. This work sets the stage for future growth in agent capabilities and community contributions.

**Key Updates:**
- **Architecture:** Implemented a dynamic plugin loading system to improve extensibility ([#3339](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/3339)) and overhauled the database by splitting the user table into agents and entities for better multi-tenancy ([#3637](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/3637)).
- **Web3 & DeFi:** Added new plugins for cryptocurrency data (CoinMarketCap [#3134](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/3134], CoinGecko [#3124](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/3124)) and DeFi operations (Edwin [#3045](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/3045)).
- **AI Models:** Expanded AI provider support to include NEAR AI ([#3275](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/3275)), Secret AI ([#3615](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/3615]), and ElevenLabs for voice synthesis ([#3452](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/3452)).
- **Social Integrations:** Enhanced the Twitter client with configurable post generation ([#3219](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/3219)) and enabled plugins to post to Telegram ([#3314](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/3314)).
- **Performance:** Replaced pnpm with Bun for faster package management and script execution ([#2852](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/2852)).
- **Documentation & Testing:** Added a new remote deployment guide ([#3501](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/3501)) and created a plugin registry showcase page ([#3620](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/3620)).
- **Resolved Issues:** Fixed a critical build failure caused by a syntax error in `package.json` ([#3276](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/3276)) and resolved a bug in model configuration loading from character files ([#3233](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/3233)).
