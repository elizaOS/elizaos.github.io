On Oct 7, 2025, the ElizaOS project made significant strides in enhancing core agent stability and character schema validation, while also addressing critical import issues affecting the Eliza CLI. A major focus was placed on diagnosing and recommending solutions for a widespread import error in `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, alongside optimizations for the knowledge graph and various bug fixes across repositories.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussion: Eliza CLI Import Issues Diagnosis and Resolution** ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6031), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6031), [elizaos/eliza#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)): The ElizaOS team needs to consider deprecating `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1 from npm and implementing publish-time validation to prevent future occurrences of missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Agent Stability & Configuration
- Critical fixes were implemented to address issues with agent plugins not reloading correctly after configuration updates and race conditions during service initialization, ensuring more robust and reliable agent operation ([elizaos/eliza#6040](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6040)).
- The bootstrap plugin received fixes to ensure `BOOTSTRAP_KEEP_RESP` functions correctly across all message handling paths and improved handling of boolean values in text parsing ([elizaos/eliza#6041](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6041), [elizaos/eliza#6042](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6042)).

### Character Schema & Core Runtime Enhancements
- The character schema validation system received a significant upgrade with comprehensive Zod schema definitions, enhancing type safety and providing detailed descriptions for better data integrity ([elizaos/eliza#6044](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6044)).
- Improvements were made to the core runtime, including exposing the state cache and refining bootstrap types, and the CLI gained support for `SERVER_PORT` environment variable and improved port validation ([elizaos/eliza#6045](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6045), [elizaos/eliza#6046](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6046), [elizaos/eliza#6038](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6038)).

### Knowledge Graph Optimization
- Significant work was done to enhance the knowledge graph, focusing on performance and memory efficiency, including improvements to retrieval algorithms and memory management for large knowledge bases ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/35)).
