Today, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in core stability and configuration with critical bug fixes and enhanced schema validation in `elizaos/eliza`, alongside key optimizations in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge` for improved performance and memory usage. A major cross-repository issue regarding Eliza CLI import errors was thoroughly diagnosed, revealing a problem with `@elizaos/core@1.6.1`'s TypeScript declaration files.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - **elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana**: The `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61` issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6031) requires the ElizaOS team to consider upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later, potentially yanking v1.6.1 from npm, and adding publish-time validation.
    - **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**: The `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61` issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6031) needs the ElizaOS team to consider deprecating v1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core` and adding publish-time validation.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core System Stability & Configuration
- Fixed a critical bug preventing agent plugins from reloading correctly after PATCH updates and addressing a race condition during service initialization in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6040](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6040)).
- Implemented robust validation for CLI `--port` and `SERVER_PORT` configurations, with warnings and default fallbacks in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6046](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6046), [elizaos/eliza#6038](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6038)).
- Exposed `stateCache` for better state management and refactored bootstrap types to consume it, along with minor fixes to prompt and provider access in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6045](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6045)).
- Improved the `parseBooleanFromText` utility to directly handle boolean inputs in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6042](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6042)).
- Ensured `BOOTSTRAP_KEEP_RESP` functions correctly even when not explicitly ignored in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6041](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6041)).

### Knowledge Graph & Character Schema Enhancements
- Enhanced knowledge retrieval algorithms and improved memory management for large knowledge bases in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge` ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/35)).
- Optimized `src/frontend/ui/memory-graph-optimized.tsx` and related UI components for efficiency in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge` ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/35)).
- Significantly enhanced character schema validation with comprehensive Zod schema definitions, including detailed descriptions and improved type safety in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6044](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6044)).
