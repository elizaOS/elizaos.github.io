On Aug 11, 2025, ElizaOS significantly advanced its core AI agent capabilities and infrastructure. Key developments included a new character type system, enhanced OpenAI API compliance for tool calls, and the integration of an EVM plugin. Core infrastructure saw improvements with a Hono server and agent registry refactor, alongside critical bug fixes and import optimizations, while two new critical issues were opened regarding agent testing and plugin publishing.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738): Build failure in `@elizaos/core` is preventing `bun run clean` and blocking complex scenario testing, requiring an update on its resolution.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719): The `startAgent` function is hanging, likely due to issues with the `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` or workspace dependency resolution, and requires an update on its resolution.
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#5749](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5749): Discussion is needed on implementing runtime method mocking for deterministic agent testing, especially for LLM interactions.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754): A critical bug where `elizaos publish --npm` falsely reports success needs immediate attention as plugins are not being published to npm.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Enhanced Agent Capabilities & API Compliance**:
    - Implemented a new character type system, including a Jesse Pollak (jesseXBT) character, to improve API consistency. [elizaos/eliza#5756](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5756)
    - Enabled visibility of intermediate tool calls and results in the chat completions API while maintaining full OpenAI API compliance. [elizaos/eliza#5755](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5755)
- **Core Infrastructure & EVM Integration**:
    - Significantly improved the agent management system by adding a Hono server and refactoring the ElizaOS agent registry to enable interaction via an OpenAI-compatible API. [elizaos/eliza#5753](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5753)
    - Introduced a new EVM plugin, integrating wallet and blockchain tooling, including services for managing EVM chains and clients, and tools for interacting with wallets. [elizaos/eliza#5752](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5752)
- **Development Workflow Improvements**:
    - Fixed failing component tests in the project-starter template by replacing `mock.module` with `spyOn` for consistent logger testing. [elizaos/eliza#5748](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5748)
    - Standardized import paths by converting to `@/` aliases and using barrels, along with a new Cursor rule for import consistency, following a temporary revert to relative paths. [elizaos/eliza#5751](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5751)

## üêû Issue Triage
- **New Issues**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#5749](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5749): Need for implementing runtime method mocking for deterministic agent testing, specifically for LLM interactions.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754): Critical bug where `elizaos publish --npm` falsely reports successful plugin publishing, despite the plugin not being published due to a 404 error.
