Today, ElizaOS significantly advanced its core agent capabilities with a new character type system and enhanced OpenAI API compliance for tool calls, alongside integrating a new EVM plugin for blockchain tooling. Core infrastructure was also strengthened with a Hono server and refactored agent registry, while critical build and testing issues were addressed.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Enhanced Agent Capabilities & API Compliance**:
    - A new character type system, including "JesseXBT," was introduced to improve API consistency for agents. [elizaos/eliza#5756](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5756)
    - The chat completions API now supports visibility of intermediate tool calls and results while maintaining full OpenAI API compliance. [elizaos/eliza#5755](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5755)
- **Core Infrastructure & EVM Integration**:
    - The ElizaOS agent registry was refactored with the addition of a Hono server, enabling OpenAI-compatible API interaction with agents. [elizaos/eliza#5753](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5753)
    - A new EVM plugin was integrated, providing wallet and blockchain tooling, including services for managing EVM chains and clients, and tools for token and wallet balance retrieval. [elizaos/eliza#5752](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5752)
- **Build System & Testing Improvements**:
    - Failing component tests in the project-starter template were fixed by replacing `mock.module` with `spyOn` for consistent logger testing. [elizaos/eliza#5748](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5748)
    - Import paths were standardized by converting to `@/` aliases and barrel imports, along with a new Cursor rule for import consistency. [elizaos/eliza#5751](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5751)
    - A temporary revert to relative import paths was performed as part of the import path standardization process. [elizaos/eliza/pull/5750](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5750)

## üêû Issue Triage
- **New Issues**:
    - elizaos/eliza:
        - [elizaos/eliza#5749](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5749): Highlights the need for implementing runtime method mocking for deterministic agent testing, specifically for LLM interactions.
        - [elizaos/eliza#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754): Reports that plugin publishing fails with false success reports, where `elizaos publish --npm` indicates success despite a 404 error.
