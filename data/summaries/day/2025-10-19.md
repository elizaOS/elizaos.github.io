Today, ElizaOS focused on core service enhancements in the `eliza` repository, including a new `MessageService` and `PATCH` method support, alongside significant code formatting and a `develop` to `main` merge. Concurrently, the `elizaos.github.io` repository initiated work on adaptive rate limiting to improve multi-repository data ingestion performance.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Service & API Enhancements
- Added `MessageService` interface and default implementation to improve message handling capabilities in `eliza`. [elizaos/eliza#6048](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6048)
- Added `PATCH` method support to the `Route` type, expanding API flexibility in `eliza`. [elizaos/eliza#6076](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6076)
- Ensured `channelId` is consistently included in session API responses in `eliza`, improving data consistency. [elizaos/eliza#6079](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6079)

### Codebase Maintenance & Optimization
- Merged the `develop` branch into `main` in `eliza`, integrating recent development work. [elizaos/eliza#6078](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6078)
- Applied consistent code formatting and style across the `eliza` codebase. [elizaos/eliza#6077](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6077)
- Made the embedding service optional in `eliza`, functioning as a no-op when no `TEXT_EMBEDDING` model is registered, optimizing resource usage. [elizaos/eliza#6075](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6075)
