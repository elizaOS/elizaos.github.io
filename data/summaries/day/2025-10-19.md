ElizaOS saw significant progress today with core framework enhancements in `elizaos/eliza`, including a new `MessageService` interface and an optional embedding service, alongside critical bug fixes and code quality improvements. Concurrently, `elizaos/elizaos.github.io` initiated work on adaptive rate limiting to boost multi-repository ingestion performance.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Core Service Enhancements
- The `elizaos/eliza` framework now includes a `MessageService` interface and its default implementation, improving message handling capabilities ([elizaos/eliza#6048](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6048)).
- Support for the `PATCH` method was added to the `Route` type in `elizaos/eliza`, expanding API flexibility ([elizaos/eliza#6076](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6076)).
- The embedding service in `elizaos/eliza` was made optional, functioning as a no-op when no `TEXT_EMBEDDING` model is registered, optimizing resource usage ([elizaos/eliza#6075](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6075)).

### API Response and Code Quality Improvements
- A bug fix in `elizaos/eliza` ensures the `channelId` is now included in session API responses, providing more complete data for WebSocket connections ([elizaos/eliza#6079](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6079)).
- A comprehensive code formatting pass was conducted across the `elizaos/eliza` codebase using Prettier/ESLint, improving readability and maintainability ([elizaos/eliza#6077](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6077)).

### Development Branch Merges
- The `develop` branch was merged into `main` in `elizaos/eliza`, integrating recent changes such as a pluggable message service, a `generateText` API, unified server startup/configuration, and a Docker/ECS deploy command for the CLI ([elizaos/eliza#6078](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6078)).
