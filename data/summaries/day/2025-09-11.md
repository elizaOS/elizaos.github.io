On September 11, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused on enhancing core stability and laying the groundwork for significant architectural refactors. Key achievements include resolving critical test flakiness and improving cache awareness in core settings, alongside fixing documentation issues. Looking ahead, several new issues were opened to plan for database adapter improvements, entity consolidation, and better SDK integration, indicating a strategic push towards a more robust and adaptable framework.
