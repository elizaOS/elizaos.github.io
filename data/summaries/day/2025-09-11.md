On September 11, 2025, ElizaOS focused on enhancing core stability by fixing test flakiness and improving environment variable handling, alongside significant architectural planning for future database adapters, core entity refactoring, and SDK integration. Several new issues were opened to guide these upcoming developments, while minor documentation improvements were also completed.
