Today's development focused on enhancing the ElizaOS core framework, with significant efforts in improving code modularity and logging functionality. Key achievements include restructuring type definitions for better maintainability and refining log outputs, alongside addressing several bugs to improve stability. Emerging challenges include issues with logging configuration and the knowledge management feature.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Codebase Refinements & Modularity
- Split the large `types.ts` file into more manageable, logical sections to enhance maintainability in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#4999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4999)).

### Logging & Documentation Improvements
- Excluded text embedding content from debug logs to improve readability in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#5003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5003)).
- Resolved an issue where the logs viewer incorrectly displayed an empty state when data was present in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#5006](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5006)).
- Corrected typos in the `gitcoin-passport.md` documentation in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#5008](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5008)).

### Stability & Bug Fixes
- Attempted to fix matrix run issues on Windows in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#5007](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5007)).

## üêû Issue Triage
### New Issues
- **elizaos/eliza**: Reported that `LOG_LEVEL` set in `.env` files is ignored, functioning only when set via command line ([elizaos/eliza#5005](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5005)).
- **elizaos/eliza**: Identified that the knowledge management (RAG) feature is not functioning as expected in version 1.0.6, with relevant code commented out ([elizaos/eliza#5004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5004)).
