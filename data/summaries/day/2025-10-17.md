Oct 17, 2025 - Overall Project Summary

Today, the ElizaOS project made significant strides in core agent functionality and infrastructure. Key achievements include migrating agent identification to UUIDs, implementing asynchronous evaluator execution, and centralizing character builder logic in the `eliza` repository. Concurrently, the `elizaos.github.io` repository focused on enhancing analytics tracking by including the `elizaos/docs` repository and excluding bot contributions, alongside addressing critical documentation and deployment issues.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Core Agent & Runtime Enhancements
- Agent identification was migrated to use UUIDs exclusively, updating loader, runtime, server, and database components. [elizaos/eliza#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036)
- Evaluators now run asynchronously in the background with improved error handling, and the bootstrap message flow triggers evaluator execution non-blockingly. [elizaos/eliza#6066](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6066)

### Documentation, Scaffolding, and Bug Fixes
- Critical bugs in the memory viewer were addressed, specifically regarding chat and user message filtering. [elizaos/eliza#6067](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6067)
- Template lookup paths were fixed, and CLI command syntax was corrected in multiple README files across both `eliza` and `elizaos.github.io`. [elizaos/eliza#6072](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6072), [elizaos/eliza#6071](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6071), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6070)

### Infrastructure & Analytics Improvements
- The character builder logic (`buildCharacterPlugins()`) was moved to the core package, centralizing business logic and removing duplicate code, with 27 new tests added. [elizaos/eliza#6069](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6069)
- The analytics pipeline was updated to include the `elizaos/docs` repository for tracking and "claude" was added to the bot users exclusion list for more accurate reporting. [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#151](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/151)
