Today, ElizaOS saw significant progress in core agent functionality with the migration to UUIDs for agent identification and asynchronous evaluator execution. Critical documentation and scaffolding issues were resolved across both `elizaos.github.io` and `eliza`, alongside enhancements to analytics tracking and the opening of new issues for deployment and ingestion pipeline improvements. The team also focused on framework consistency and stability, closing several long-standing issues.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Agent Functionality & Stability
- Agent identification migrated to UUIDs, updating loader, runtime, server, and database components, enabling duplicate agent names ([elizaos/eliza#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036)).
- Evaluators now run asynchronously with improved error handling, and bootstrap messages trigger non-blocking evaluator execution ([elizaos/eliza#6066](https://github.com/eliza/pull/6066)).
- Character builder logic moved to the core package, centralizing business logic and adding 27 new tests ([elizaos/eliza#6069](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6069)).
- Critical bugs in the memory viewer were addressed, specifically regarding chat and user message filtering ([elizaos/eliza#6067](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6067)).
- Framework consistency and stability issues were closed, ensuring CLI and server adhere to ElizaOS defaults, consolidating duplicated helpers, and enforcing consistent logging ([elizaos/eliza#5934](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5934)).

### Documentation & Scaffolding Improvements
- Incorrect plugin documentation and scaffolding problems were fixed, including template lookup paths and CLI command syntax in multiple READMEs ([elizaos/eliza#6072](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6072), [elizaos/eliza#6071](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6071), [elizaos/eliza.github.io#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6070)).

### Analytics & Deployment Enhancements
- The analytics pipeline was updated to track the `elizaos/docs` repository and exclude "claude" from bot users for more accurate reporting ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#151](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/151)).
- Progress was made on enhancing plugin capabilities and deployment options, including improving `plugin-autocoder`, integrating Eigen TEE, and implementing a unified Cloud API plugin ([elizaos/eliza#5685](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5685), [elizaos/eliza#5986](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5986), [elizaos/eliza#6049](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6049)).
