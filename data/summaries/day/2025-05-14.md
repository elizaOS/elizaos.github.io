On May 14, 2025, the ElizaOS project significantly advanced plugin support, enabling installations directly from GitHub URLs and improving modularity. Key bug fixes addressed issues with the community manager's default settings and enhanced LLM response parsing, while efforts were made to reduce log clutter during client builds for a cleaner development environment.

## âœ… Completed Work

### Plugin Enhancements & Modularity
- Introduced support for installing plugins directly from GitHub URLs, including both HTTPS and shorthand formats ([elizaos/eliza#4577](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4577)).
- Added a submodule for plugin specification, improving modularity ([elizaos/eliza#4553](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4553)).
- Implemented tests for the `create-eliza` command to ensure reliability ([elizaos/eliza#4582](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4582)).

### Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements
- Set the community manager to use `plugin-local-ai` by default in development builds, addressing multiple reported issues ([elizaos/eliza#4557](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4557)).
- Improved the association of knowledge items with agents, ensuring uploaded knowledge is correctly linked ([elizaos/eliza#4581](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4581)).
- Enhanced LLM response parsing to support custom fields and eliminate empty message headers ([elizaos/eliza#4580](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4580)).

### Code Maintenance & Developer Experience
- Removed unnecessary log spam during client builds, contributing to a cleaner output and improved developer experience ([elizaos/eliza#4584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4584)).
- Added Autofun Buy and Sell functionality through contracts ([elizaos/eliza#4397](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4397)).
