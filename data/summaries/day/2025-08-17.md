On August 17, 2025, ElizaOS development focused on critical bug fixes in the `eliza` repository, resolving CI test failures and a database error, while also initiating a new feature for asynchronous embedding generation. Additionally, research began on integrating attestations into the `elizaos.github.io` platform.
