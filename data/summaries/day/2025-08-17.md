On August 17, 2025, ElizaOS focused on critical bug fixes and foundational improvements, particularly in the `eliza` repository where CI stability and database errors were resolved, and a new asynchronous embedding feature was initiated. Concurrently, the `elizaos.github.io` team began researching attestation integration, exploring options like SAS/EAS. The day's activities underscore a dual focus on enhancing system reliability and exploring future capabilities.
