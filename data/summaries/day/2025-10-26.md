On October 26, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in unifying messaging APIs and critical bug fixes. A new pull request was opened for a unified messaging API in the main `eliza` repository, while the `plugin-solana` repository addressed a race condition in its service initialization. The team also closed an important issue related to testing and reliability in the `eliza` repository.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core System Stability & Testing
*   **Enhanced Testing and Reliability**: The `eliza` repository closed an issue focused on adding smoke and integration tests for CLI commands, verifying backward compatibility, and improving CLI error messages. [elizaos/eliza#5935](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5935)

### Plugin Reliability
