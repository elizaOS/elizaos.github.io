Today, ElizaOS saw significant progress in documentation, including a new "Launch Resources" page and renaming the "API Reference" to "REST Reference" for clarity. A new self-sovereign identity plugin for the Nuggets platform was added, while core agent runtime enhancements were implemented, and the CLI was streamlined by removing Claude dependencies. A critical recurring issue regarding a `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` error in the CLI after installation has been reported across multiple repositories and requires immediate attention.
