On February 18, 2026, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in expanding its plugin ecosystem with new integrations for the SAID Protocol on Solana and SolCex Exchange BD, alongside foundational updates in the core `eliza` repository including dependency management and on-chain identity features. A critical bug fix was also implemented in `plugin-n8n-workflow` to correctly handle property visibility, while a new issue emerged in `plugin-ollama` concerning embedding errors.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Plugin Ecosystem Expansion
*   A critical bug was fixed in `plugin-n8n-workflow` to ensure default property values are applied before visibility checks, resolving issues with dependent fields when structural fields are omitted by the LLM.
