Today, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in core stability with a critical fix for TypeScript type exports in the `@elizaos/core` package, improving external integration. Concurrently, the plugin ecosystem began expanding with the introduction of a new plugin for Vercel AI Gateway, broadening ElizaOS agents' integration capabilities.
