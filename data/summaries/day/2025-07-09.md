Today, the primary focus was on the `eliza` repository, which saw significant feature additions including a new forms plugin and client-side UX improvements, alongside critical bug fixes for installation issues and action chaining. While other repositories had no direct development activity, new issues emerged regarding Twitter API rate limits and ongoing dependency installation challenges across the ecosystem.

## üö® Needs Attention

- **Urgent Discussions**: [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/38) "Failed to fetch Home timeline (429 Too Many Requests)" indicates a potential underlying issue with Twitter API call handling that needs investigation.
