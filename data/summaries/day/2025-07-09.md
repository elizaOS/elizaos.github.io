# Overall Project Update (Jul 9, 2025)

## Overview
Today saw significant progress in the `eliza` repository, particularly with the development and comprehensive testing of a new forms plugin and the relocation of client distribution. Several critical bugs were addressed across various components, including Google Generative AI plugin installation and action chaining. Concurrently, `plugin-twitter` focused on addressing installation and API rate limit issues, while `plugin-solana` and `auto.fun` had no development activity.
