On Sep 28, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant internal improvements, primarily focusing on core runtime refactoring, standardization of type definitions, and a crucial bug fix for plugin import logging, alongside a repository-wide code formatting pass. These efforts aim to enhance the stability, maintainability, and consistency of the ElizaOS framework.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Runtime & Type System Refinements
*   The core runtime was substantially refactored to improve initialization idempotency, enhance service registration coordination, and remove legacy code, contributing to a cleaner and more robust core ([elizaos/eliza#6004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6004)).
*   A comprehensive effort standardized and improved type definitions across multiple packages (`packages/cli`, `packages/core`, `packages/plugin-bootstrap`, `packages/server`, `packages/service-interfaces`), enhancing code consistency and maintainability ([elizaos/eliza#5998](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5998)).

### Stability & Maintainability Improvements
*   A bug fix was implemented to downgrade dynamic plugin import failures from errors to warnings, acknowledging that such failures are often recoverable and improving the user experience ([elizaos/eliza#6010](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6010)).
*   A repository-wide linter pass was completed, refactoring code formatting for improved readability and consistency without altering logic ([elizaos/eliza#6011](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6011)).

## üêû Issue Triage
### Closed Issues
*   **elizaos/eliza**: An unhandled exception in the Agent Runtime when `getAgents()` failed due to a missing agents table was closed, addressed by a related pull request ([elizaos/eliza#6003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6003)).
