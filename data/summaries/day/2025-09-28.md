Today, the ElizaOS project focused heavily on core runtime stability and code quality within the `elizaos/eliza` repository, with significant refactoring of type definitions and runtime initialization processes, alongside a crucial bug fix for plugin import logging. A repository-wide code formatting pass also improved consistency and readability.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Runtime Stability & Type System Improvements
- Refactored the core runtime initialization for idempotency and improved service registration, removing legacy code paths ([elizaos/eliza#6004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6004)).
- Implemented a comprehensive refactoring of type definitions across `packages/cli`, `packages/core`, `packages/plugin-bootstrap`, `packages/service-interfaces`, and `packages/test-utils` ([elizaos/eliza#5998](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5998)).
- Addressed an unhandled exception in `runtime.ts` when `getAgents()` failed due to a missing agents table ([elizaos/eliza#6003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6003)).

### Plugin Management & Error Handling
- Downgraded the log level for dynamic plugin import failures from an error to a warning in `packages/server/src/managers/PluginLoader.ts`, acknowledging recoverable initial failures ([elizaos/eliza#6010](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6010)).

### Code Quality & Consistency
- Executed a linter pass across the entire repository to standardize code formatting for improved readability and consistency ([elizaos/eliza#6011](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6011)).

## üêû Issue Triage
### Closed Issues
- **elizaos/eliza**: An unhandled exception when `getAgents()` failed in `runtime.ts` due to a missing agents table was addressed and closed ([elizaos/eliza#6003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6003)).
