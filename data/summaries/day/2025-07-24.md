Today's focus across ElizaOS was dominated by a critical logger migration from `pino` to `adze` to ensure compatibility with Bun builds, with significant progress reported across `elizaos/eliza`, `elizaos/auto.fun`, `elizaos-plugins/registry`, and `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge`. Additionally, key CLI and plugin publishing bugs were resolved in `elizaos/eliza`, and `plugin-knowledge` expanded its capabilities by integrating Ollama.
