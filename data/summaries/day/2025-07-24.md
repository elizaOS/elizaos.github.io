Today's focus was on critical infrastructure improvements, primarily a widespread logger migration from `pino` to `adze` across multiple repositories to ensure compatibility with Bun builds, with the core migration code now complete and awaiting verification. Concurrently, significant progress was made on plugin development, including adding Ollama support to `plugin-knowledge` and addressing several CLI and plugin creation stability issues in the `eliza` repository. A new issue was also opened regarding the `autofun` smart contract's architecture.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos-plugins/registry#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5673): The `pino` to `adze` logger migration is code-complete and requires verification by running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build`.
    - [elizaos/auto.fun#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5673): The `pino` to `adze` logger migration is code-complete and requires verification by running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build`.
    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5673): The `pino` to `adze` logger migration is code-complete and requires verification by running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build`.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### CLI and Plugin Stability Improvements
- Critical fixes were implemented to enhance the reliability of the CLI and plugin creation process, including ensuring `.gitignore` files are correctly included in published npm packages and correcting a spelling error in the plugin starter.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5675](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5675)
    - [elizaos/eliza#5674](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5674)
- Several issues related to the CLI and plugin creation were resolved, improving the developer experience, such as fixing an agent not responding in the GUI and resolving a `zod` module error when publishing newly created plugins.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5617](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5617)
    - [elizaos/eliza#5657](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5657)

### Documentation Updates
