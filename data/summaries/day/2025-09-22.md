Today, the ElizaOS project focused on critical infrastructure improvements and bug fixes across its core framework and plugins. Key achievements include standardizing environment variables and improving TypeScript declaration generation in the `eliza` core, upgrading AI SDK dependencies and migrating test suites in `plugin-knowledge`, and fixing a critical package name bug in the `registry`.
