### Core System Stability & Developer Experience
*   Standardized PGLite data directory configuration across examples, CLI, and the SQL plugin in `elizaos/eliza`, resolving inconsistencies and improving maintainability. ([elizaos/eliza#5987](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5987))
*   Addressed TypeScript build configuration issues in `elizaos/eliza` to ensure more reliable declaration generation and consistent code formatting. ([elizaos/eliza#5993](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5993))

### Plugin Registry & Infrastructure Updates
*   Fixed a critical bug in `elizaos-plugins/registry` by updating the package name for the token metrics plugin from `@token-metrics` to `@token-metrics-ai` in `index.json`, ensuring correct referencing. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#232](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/232))
*   Upgraded AI SDK dependencies from v1 to v2 for `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, `@ai-sdk/google`, and `@ai-sdk/openai` in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge`, and updated `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider` to v1.2.0 to maintain compatibility. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/40))
*   Migrated the test suite in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge` from Vitest to the Bun test framework, streamlining the testing process. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/40))
