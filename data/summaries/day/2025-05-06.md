Today's development focused on enhancing the ElizaOS framework through critical bug fixes, particularly resolving Discord service timeout issues and improving client interface scrolling. Documentation links were updated to ensure accessibility, and several user experience issues were closed, though a gap in `settings.discord.autoPost` implementation for Eliza v2 was identified.
