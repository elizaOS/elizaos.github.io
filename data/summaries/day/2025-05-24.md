Today, the ElizaOS project significantly enhanced user interaction with comprehensive image and video chat support and improved configuration options. Efforts also focused on refining the development environment through real-time log streaming and streamlining workflows by refactoring publishing processes. Two new API endpoint issues were identified in the `elizaos/eliza` repository.
