On August 20, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in core functionalities with enhanced session management and service load handling in `elizaos/eliza`, alongside the closure of a major epic related to the Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System across both `elizaos/eliza` and `elizaos-plugins/registry`, indicating a push towards robust testing infrastructure.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core System Enhancements
*   **Enhanced Session Management**: The sessions API in `elizaos/eliza` received a significant upgrade, introducing comprehensive timeout management, auto-renewal capabilities, and robust error handling for improved session lifecycle control ([elizaos/eliza#5799](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5799)).
*   **Core Runtime and Plugin Improvements**: A new `getServiceLoadPromise` interface was added to the runtime in `elizaos/eliza`, improving how services are loaded. Additionally, component queries in the `plugin-sql` were fixed to be more flexible and robust, particularly concerning date handling ([elizaos/eliza#5801](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5801)).
