On July 16, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in addressing core architectural challenges, particularly around agent-to-agent communication and custom plugin schema migrations, with a proposed solution for direct, synchronous agent communication now implemented. Additionally, a long-standing character migration tool was released, while new issues emerged concerning agent creation directory problems and API key configuration.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588): Discussion on custom plugin schema migration issues requires input on ensuring proper plugin schema structure and dependency declarations to resolve skipped agent-level migrations.
    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31): The persistent Twitter client initialization error, often linked to database query failures during memory insertion, needs further investigation and resolution.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Core System Improvements**:
    - A character migrator tool for v1 to v2 character migration has been released, closing a long-standing development issue. [elizaos/eliza#5452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5452)
- **Testing Infrastructure Enhancements**:
    - A comprehensive test suite for queries and various utility functions was established, significantly enhancing code reliability. [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#144](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/144)

## üèóÔ∏è Work in Progress
- **Active Discussions**:
    - **Agent-to-Agent Communication Without Polling**: A comprehensive solution involving a new OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`/api/openai/v1/chat/completions`) has been proposed and implemented to enable direct, synchronous agent communication, eliminating polling and supporting streaming.
