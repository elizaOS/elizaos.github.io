On July 16, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress in addressing core architectural challenges, particularly around agent-to-agent communication and custom plugin schema migrations, with a comprehensive solution proposed for direct agent messaging. Concurrently, new issues emerged concerning agent creation and API key configuration, while testing infrastructure received a major upgrade.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588): Detailed analysis and solutions for custom plugin schema migration challenges have been provided by @claude; team input is needed to decide on the best path forward (e.g., server-level registration vs. manual workarounds).
    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31): Multiple users are still reporting "Twitter Client Initialization Error" despite successful authentication, indicating a persistent issue with memory insertion queries that needs immediate investigation to enable autonomous Twitter agent operation.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5603](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5603), [elizaos/eliza#5606](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5606): New issues highlight critical "ENOENT" errors during agent creation on Windows and `.eliza` directory hoisting, requiring urgent attention to unblock new users.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5604](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5604), [elizaos/eliza#5605](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5605): Users are unable to create projects without providing API keys, indicating a need to make API key setup optional during `npx elizaos create`.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Core System Enhancements**:
    - The v1 to v2 character migrator has been finalized and closed in [elizaos/eliza#5452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5452), providing a complete tool for character data transition between ElizaOS versions.
