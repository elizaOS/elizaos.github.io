ElizaOS made significant strides today, enhancing its core architecture with standardized interfaces and improved CLI tooling, including a new backend-only plugin template, while also implementing multi-repository summarization for improved reporting. A new plugin, `plugin-bonsai`, was published to the registry, though ongoing discussions persist regarding Twitter API rate limits affecting timeline fetching.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**: The "Twitter API Rate Limit and Timeline Fetching Issues" ([elizaos-plugins/registry#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38), [elizaos/eliza#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38)) requires clarification on the specific rate limit for the $200/month Twitter API tier to determine if it's a viable solution for users.
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**: The "Plugin Schema Migration Challenges" ([elizaos/eliza#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588)) needs investigation into why `DatabaseMigrationService` is not registered as a runtime service, potentially blocking custom plugin schema migrations.
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**: The "Environment Variable Parsing Issue" ([elizaos/eliza#5590](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5590)) needs attention to resolve issues with environment variable reading when values are enclosed in quotes.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Framework Enhancements
- **Standardized Service Interfaces**: Implemented service types and standardized interfaces, including a `getServicesByType()` method, to improve modularity and extensibility for building abstract plugins. ([elizaos/eliza#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565))
- **CLI Tooling Improvements**: Introduced a new `plugin-quick-starter` template for backend-only plugins, improved CI tests for the CLI, and migrated to Bun's native process spawning for better performance. ([elizaos/eliza#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589), [elizaos/eliza#5586](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5586))
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Addressed issues such as improved `bunx` detection, correct `installModelPlugin` calls, handling of port conflicts, and removal of plaintext passwords from test constants, enhancing stability and security. ([elizaos/eliza#5599](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5599), [elizaos/eliza#5598](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5598), [elizaos/eliza#5597](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5597), [elizaos/eliza#5592](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5592))
- **Ollama Plugin Refinement & Type Safety**: Made Ollama plugin integration conditional, resolved TypeScript `any` type violations, and removed duplicate interface definitions, improving type safety and build stability. ([elizaos/eliza#5594](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5594), [elizaos/eliza#5593](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5593), [elizaos/eliza#5587](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5587), [elizaos/eliza#5596](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5596))

### Reporting & Plugin Registry
- **Multi-Repository Summarization**: Implemented a major new feature enabling the generation of overall project summaries across all repositories, significantly improving reporting and analytical capabilities. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142))
- **New Plugin Publication**: The `plugin-bonsai` has been successfully published to the registry, meeting all inclusion checklist items. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191))
