On October 2, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress in expanding its plugin ecosystem with the integration of a new relay plugin and updates to the Discord plugin for enhanced message processing. Concurrently, new development efforts are underway to refine agent response logic and improve code quality, though a new critical issue regarding CLI import errors has emerged, requiring immediate attention.
