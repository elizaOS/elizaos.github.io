Overall Project Summary:
Today's development saw significant progress in the `elizaos/eliza` core, with a critical bug fix for DM channel creation logic and new PRs addressing Windows plugin loading and CLI command refinements. Concurrently, `elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter` initiated foundational work to switch its test setup to Bun, aligning with ElizaOS standards. Other repositories remained quiet.
