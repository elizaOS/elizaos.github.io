ElizaOS's development on September 10, 2025, focused on significant enhancements to monitoring and debugging capabilities within the core `eliza` repository, alongside foundational work for backend runs tracking. Additionally, a new plugin was added to the registry, and a utility for boolean parsing was introduced in `plugin-twitter`. Critical bug fixes and dependency updates also contributed to overall system stability.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Enhanced Monitoring and Debugging
*   Sentry's Vercel AI integration was added to the server for improved error tracking ([elizaos/eliza#5963](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5963)).
*   The Sentry browser SDK was removed from the core package to optimize size and prevent conflicts ([elizaos/eliza#5961](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5961)).
*   Client-side debugging was enhanced with sourcemaps and improved React version handling ([elizaos/eliza#5962](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5962)).

### Backend Infrastructure Development
*   Foundational backend components for runs tracking were implemented across the server, core, bootstrap, and API client packages, including structured logging and new API client services ([elizaos/eliza#5953](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5953)).

### Plugin Ecosystem Updates
*   The `@standujar/plugin-composio` plugin was added to the registry's `index.json` file ([elizaos-plugins/registry#217](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/217)).

### Critical Bug Fixes and Dependency Updates
*   A `Buffer` to `Blob` type compatibility error in the API client was resolved ([elizaos/eliza#5960](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5960)).
*   TypeScript build errors in `plugin-bootstrap` were fixed ([elizaos/eliza#5959](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5959)).
*   Action notifications were fixed to only send for `client_chat` messages ([elizaos/eliza#5957](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5957)).
*   The `vite` dependency in the client package was updated from 6.1.6 to 6.3.6 ([elizaos/eliza#5946](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5946)).
