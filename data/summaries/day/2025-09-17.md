Today, ElizaOS focused on enhancing core stability and expanding plugin capabilities. Key achievements include significant improvements to the CLI's stability, especially on Windows, and refining the update mechanism to ensure users receive relevant notifications based on their distribution channel. Additionally, a new plugin was added to the registry, while ongoing discussions address critical issues like Web UI documentation and a persistent SQL database error affecting the Twitter plugin.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Stability & Build Process Enhancements
- **CLI Stability and Windows CI Improvements**: Significant effort was put into improving the CLI's stability, particularly for Windows environments, including comprehensive enhancements to `dev` command tests and resolving process management issues that caused CI failures. [elizaos/eliza#5982](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5982)
- **Refined Update Mechanism and Build Process**: The CLI update checker was fixed to correctly respect distribution channels, preventing irrelevant update prompts. Critical fixes were also implemented for client bundling, dev-loop restarts, database runtime modes, and stricter TypeScript type-check failures to halt builds, alongside improved build ordering for the web UI. [elizaos/eliza#5980](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5980), [elizaos/eliza#5985](https://github.com/eliza/pull/5985)

### Plugin Registry Expansion
- **New Plugin Added**: A new plugin, `plugin-octav`, was added to the registry's `index.json` file, expanding the available plugins within the ElizaOS ecosystem. [elizaos-plugins/registry#230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/230)
