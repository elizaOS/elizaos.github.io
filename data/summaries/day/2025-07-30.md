On July 30, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress in documentation standardization, with `bun:test` now exclusively used across `elizaos/eliza`, alongside critical bug fixes for knowledge path configuration in `plugin-knowledge`. A key challenge emerged regarding missing auto-deployment CI files for migrated 1.x plugins, affecting both `elizaos/eliza` and `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge`, which requires immediate attention to unblock deployments.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:
    - `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#5691`: Missing auto-deployment CI files for migrated plugins are preventing deployment; `@ai16z-demirix` has been directly asked for assistance.
    - `elizaos/eliza#5691`: Some migrated `1.x` plugins are missing auto-deployment CI files and are not being deployed.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Documentation & Consistency Improvements**:
    - Standardized all project documentation and rules files in `elizaos/eliza` to exclusively use `bun:test` as the standard testing framework, impacting `cli`, `client`, `core`, `docs`, and various `plugin` related directories. ([elizaos/eliza#5681](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5681))
    - Completed the "Full Docs Nitpick Review" in `elizaos/eliza`, indicating a significant step towards improving overall documentation quality. ([elizaos/eliza#5665](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5665))
- **Plugin Functionality & Bug Fixes**:
    - Fixed a bug in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge` that prevented the knowledge path from being read correctly from runtime settings, now allowing character-based path configurations. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/36))
    - Improved the document loading process in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge`, affecting `bun.lock`, `package.json`, `src/docs-loader.ts`, and `src/service.ts`.
    - Resolved several issues in `elizaos/eliza` concerning specific plugins including `aave`, `clanker`, `defi-llama`, and `moon-well`.
