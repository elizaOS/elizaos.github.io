On July 26, 2025, project activity was light, primarily focusing on new pull requests across two repositories: a minor typo fix in `elizaos/eliza` and the initiation of a new "Feature/mcp server" in `elizaos/elizaos.github.io`. No significant technical developments were completed, and no issues were closed or newly opened today.
