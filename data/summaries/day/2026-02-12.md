On February 12, 2026, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in refining its testing framework with the closure of several issues related to scenario testing and evaluators in `elizaos/eliza`. Additionally, new pull requests were opened to enhance plugin functionalities, including addressing authentication and media uploads in `plugin-twitter` and adding REST API routes for workflow management in `plugin-n8n-workflow`.

## ✅ Completed Work

### Testing Framework Enhancements
*   **Enhanced Scenario Testing Capabilities:** An issue addressing runtime method mocking for deterministic agent testing, particularly for LLM interactions, was closed, improving the reliability of scenario tests. [elizaos/eliza#5749](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5749)
*   **New Scenario Evaluators Introduced:** Several new evaluators for scenario testing were added, including a Token Count Evaluator [elizaos/eliza#5758](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5758), a Cost Evaluator [elizaos/eliza#5759](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5759), a Consistency Evaluator [elizaos/eliza#5760](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5760), and a Step Count Evaluator [elizaos/eliza#5761](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5761).

### Documentation and Script Refinement
*   **Changelog Maintenance:** All references were removed from the `CHANGELOG.md` file. [elizaos/eliza#6495](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6495)
*   **Script Reorganization for Clarity:** Internal crawl scripts in `plugin-n8n-workflow` were reorganized and renamed for better descriptive accuracy, such as `crawl-schemas.ts` to `crawl-output-schemas.ts`.
