Today, the ElizaOS team focused heavily on core API modernization and stability, successfully migrating `elizaos/eliza` to Bun's native EventTarget API for improved performance and compatibility, alongside critical bug fixes for plugin loading and CLI functionality. Several new issues were reported, particularly concerning CLI setup on Windows and `.elizadb` directory creation.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39) "Twitter error with sql database": This issue, indicating a persistent database insertion failure for Twitter service memories, received a "+1" today, suggesting it affects multiple users and requires immediate investigation.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core API Modernization and Compatibility
- Migrated `elizaos/eliza` from Node.js EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API, enhancing performance and compatibility ([elizaos/eliza#5609](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5609)).
- Addressed critical review issues from the EventTarget migration, including type safety and method chaining support for `on()` methods ([elizaos/eliza#5614](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5614), [elizaos/eliza#5612](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5612)).
- Replaced generic `any` types with `unknown` and explicit function signatures for improved type safety across affected modules in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#5611](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5611)).
- Added comprehensive unit tests to ensure backward compatibility with EventEmitter-based patterns for both `InternalMessageBus` and `SimpleMigrationAgent` in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#5613](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5613)).

### Plugin and CLI Stability Fixes
- Resolved a critical bug in `elizaos/eliza` preventing plugin actions from loading in the NPM deployed version of the ElizaOS CLI, ensuring proper functionality for published packages ([elizaos/eliza#5624](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5624)).
- Removed the `node-fetch` dependency from the bootstrap plugin in `elizaos/eliza` to ensure full compatibility with Bun's native fetch implementation, fixing issues with message sending in Bun environments ([elizaos/eliza#5607](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5607)).

### Documentation Cleanup
- Removed obsolete documentation files related to previously implemented fixes in `elizaos/eliza`, streamlining the project's documentation ([elizaos/eliza#5621](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5621)).
