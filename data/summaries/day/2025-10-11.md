Today, ElizaOS focused on enhancing core stability and expanding voice capabilities. Key achievements include resolving critical database foreign key violations in the `eliza` server and significantly improving voice feature compatibility in `plugin-openai` by enabling Buffer and Node.js stream handling. Additionally, efforts were made to refine the end-to-end testing infrastructure and streamline CLI operations.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Stability & Database Integrity
- Fixed foreign key violation errors when starting agents in PostgreSQL environments, ensuring agent records exist before references are created. ([elizaos/eliza#6059](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6059))

### Voice Feature Enhancements & Compatibility
- Implemented support for Buffer input for the `TRANSCRIPTION` model and added functionality to convert Web `ReadableStream` to Node.js `Readable` for `TEXT_TO_SPEECH`. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/18))
- Resolved compatibility issues with Discord voice transcription and TTS playback. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/18))

### E2E Test Infrastructure Refinement
- Updated the end-to-end test runner to remove outdated `AgentManager` references, replacing them with `AgentServer`'s built-in `startAgents` method. ([elizaos/eliza#6056](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6056))
