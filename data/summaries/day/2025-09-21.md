On September 21, 2025, ElizaOS saw important updates across its ecosystem, with a focus on CLI stability in the core `eliza` repository and a significant dependency upgrade in `plugin-knowledge`. The `eliza` CLI received a critical bug fix preventing infinite restart loops, while `plugin-knowledge` began migrating to AI SDK v2 and Bun for testing. These efforts collectively enhance the robustness and modernize the underlying technologies of the ElizaOS framework.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
