On Mar 7, 2025, ElizaOS focused on refining the core Eliza framework, transitioning to Patchright for improved testing, and addressing several critical bugs related to asynchronous handling and client connectivity. Documentation was also updated for clarity, and new linting rules were implemented to maintain code quality.
