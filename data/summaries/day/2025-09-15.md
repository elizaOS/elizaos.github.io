On September 15, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in stability and compatibility, with critical bug fixes implemented in the core `eliza` repository, including image display and template compilation issues, alongside active development in the `plugin-farcaster` repository to update its SDK and resolve build errors. A new core build cleanup initiative was also launched, aiming for a pure JS/TS build validated across multiple environments.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Stability & Compatibility
*   Resolved an issue where generated images from the OpenRouter plugin were not displaying correctly in the web client by transforming local file paths to API URLs in `elizaos/eliza`. ([#5890](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5890))
*   Enabled JSON imports in `project-starter` and `project-tee-starter` templates, fixing compilation failures when users imported JSON files in `elizaos/eliza`. ([#5975](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5975))
*   Added the missing `uuid` dependency to the `plugin-sql` package, ensuring its proper functionality in `elizaos/eliza`. ([#5977](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5977))
