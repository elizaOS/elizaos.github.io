On September 15, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused on critical bug fixes within the `eliza` core, resolving image display issues in the web client and enabling JSON imports in project templates, alongside preparing the `plugin-farcaster` for future updates by addressing SDK and build errors. A new significant issue was opened to clean up the core build, aiming for a pure JS/TS implementation compatible across multiple environments.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Bug Fixes & Enhancements
*   Resolved an issue where generated images from the OpenRouter plugin were not displaying correctly in the web client by transforming local file paths to API URLs. ([elizaos/eliza#5890](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5890))
*   Enabled JSON imports in `project-starter` and `project-tee-starter` templates, fixing compilation failures when users imported JSON files. ([elizaos/eliza#5975](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5975))
*   Added a missing `uuid` dependency to the `plugin-sql` package, ensuring its proper functionality. ([elizaos/eliza#5977](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5977))
