Overall Project Summary for Aug 1, 2025:

Today's focus across ElizaOS was on refining the developer experience and streamlining the core `eliza` repository through significant cleanup. Efforts included automating CLI dependency installation and optimizing build processes, alongside removing obsolete files and outdated documentation to improve maintainability. New feature discussions emerged, particularly around dynamic action management and enhanced storage services, pointing towards future core package enhancements and cloud integration.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Developer Experience & Build Optimizations
*   Streamlined setup for new projects by automatically installing `@elizaos/cli` as a dev dependency for non-monorepo environments, and optimized build processes by removing the docs filter. ([elizaos/eliza#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702), [elizaos/eliza#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701))

### Repository Cleanup & Obsolete File Removal
*   Cleaned up the repository by removing obsolete GitHub workflow files (CLI deployment, documentation publishing, LLM text generation) and outdated documentation from `README.md` (LangChain integration, Tauri CI/CD details). ([elizaos/eliza#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700), [elizaos/eliza#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699))
