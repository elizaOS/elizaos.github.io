Today, ElizaOS focused on enhancing developer experience by streamlining CLI dependency installation and optimizing build processes. Significant repository cleanup was also performed, removing obsolete files and documentation. New feature requests emerged for core package enhancements and potential cloud deployment.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Developer Experience & Build Optimizations
- `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency for `start`/`dev` commands in non-monorepo environments, simplifying setup ([elizaos/eliza#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)).
- Build processes were optimized by removing the docs filter ([elizaos/eliza#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).

### Repository Cleanup & Obsolete File Removal
- Obsolete documentation (including outdated LangChain references and extensive Tauri CI/CD docs) and GitHub workflow files were removed to declutter the repository ([elizaos/eliza#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700), [elizaos/eliza#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).
