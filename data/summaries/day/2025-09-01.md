On Sep 1, 2025, significant progress was made on critical bug fixes, including a proposed solution for Discord image generation and a registry compatibility fix. Discussions continued on a major refactoring of the Eliza CLI to improve modularity and delegate responsibilities, alongside addressing new issues related to project creation and undocumented UI.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860) and [elizaos-plugins/registry#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5860): Active discussion is ongoing regarding the proposed refactoring of the Eliza CLI, with concerns raised about moving too much logic into projects and syncing functions across them. Input is needed to finalize the architectural approach.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5856](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5856): More information is requested from the user to debug the "path not found" error during project creation.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5857](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5857): The Web UI Dashboard is completely undocumented, leading to user confusion and requiring attention for documentation.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Registry Compatibility Fixes**:
    - A significant bug fix was implemented to correct how the registry classifies plugin versions, now using semantic version range intersection for v0 and v1 bands to resolve misclassification issues. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#214](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/214))
