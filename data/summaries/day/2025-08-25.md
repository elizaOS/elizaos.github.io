On August 25, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused heavily on stabilizing the core `eliza` runtime with critical bug fixes and refining prompt logic for improved agent behavior. A significant new initiative was launched to enable dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations, aiming to enhance the sophistication of agent testing and interaction.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819): Discussion has begun with a detailed proposal for implementing dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations, including schema extensions, termination conditions, and evaluation schemas. Input is needed to move forward with this significant feature.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Core Runtime Stability and Prompt Logic Refinements**:
    - Fixed core runtime stability issues by reverting a `processActions` change and correcting a typo. [elizaos/eliza#5817](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5817)
    - Refined prompt logic to enforce user ID requirements for authenticated actions. [elizaos/eliza#5815](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5815)
    - Streamlined prompt generation by removing a duplicate block from the message handler template. [elizaos/eliza#5812](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5812)
    - Improved the summary generation for the `exchangeDeliveredOrderItems` action for clearer descriptions. [elizaos/eliza#5818](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5818)

## üèóÔ∏è Work in Progress
