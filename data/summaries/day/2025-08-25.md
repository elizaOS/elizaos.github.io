Today, ElizaOS focused on enhancing core runtime stability and refining prompt logic within the `eliza` repository, alongside initiating work on dynamic prompting for advanced scenario testing. Key bug fixes addressed prompt handling and action result retrieval, while new issues were opened to explore multi-turn conversations and plugin visibility.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819): Discussion has begun on a detailed proposal for implementing dynamic prompting for ElizaOS scenarios, including schema extensions and class outlines for `UserSimulator` and `ConversationManager`.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Runtime Stability & Prompt Refinements
- Fixed several bugs to improve core runtime stability, including reverting a change in `processActions` to correctly retrieve action results via `cacheState` and a minor fix to the authentication prompt. [elizaos/eliza#5817](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5817), [elizaos/eliza#5815](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5815), [elizaos/eliza#5812](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5812)
- Refined prompt logic to enforce user ID requirements for actions needing authentication, enhancing security and correctness. [elizaos/eliza#5816](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5816)
- Made a minor improvement to summary generation for the `exchangeDeliveredOrderItems` action within the action bench plugin. [elizaos/eliza#5818](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5818)

## üêû Issue Triage
