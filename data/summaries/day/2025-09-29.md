On September 29, 2025, ElizaOS significantly enhanced agent run visualization with a new interactive timeline component, addressed critical package publishing issues for `@elizaos/service-interfaces`, and improved security by restricting local environment endpoint access in production. The team also updated core dependencies and began addressing new issues related to Discord plugin configuration and plugin development environment functionality.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013): A new configuration option is requested for the Discord plugin to allow the agent to respond only when explicitly mentioned or called by its configured name.
    - [elizaos/eliza#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017): The `elizaos dev` and `elizaos start` commands are reported to be non-functional when executed within a plugin directory, preventing the loading of plugins with test characters.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Agent Run Visualization & Client Enhancements
- Enhanced the client with a new interactive timeline component for detailed insights into agent execution flow and performance metrics. ([elizaos/eliza#6016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6016))

### Package Management & Security Improvements
- Implemented critical fixes for new package publishing on NPM, ensuring `@elizaos/service-interfaces` is publicly accessible and the release workflow can handle individual package publishing. ([elizaos/eliza#6012](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6012))
- Added a production guard to the `/api/system/env/local` endpoint to prevent exposure or mutation of local `.env` variables in production environments. ([elizaos/eliza#6014](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6014))

### Dependency Updates
- Updated the `zod` package to version `4.1.11` across the monorepo for consistent and up-to-date dependency management. ([elizaos/eliza#6015](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6015))
