ElizaOS made significant strides today by integrating robust plugin and configuration modules into the core framework, enhancing modularity and adaptability for AI agents. A critical, widespread issue concerning import errors in the Eliza CLI 1.61 was also resolved, improving the developer experience across multiple plugins. New feature development is underway in several plugin repositories, focusing on enhanced message processing and voice capabilities.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Framework Enhancements & Bug Fixes
- **Core Framework Enhancement: Plugin and Configuration Modules**: The core framework received a major upgrade with the introduction of new plugin and configuration modules, including automatic plugin installation, loading, validation, and dependency resolution, alongside new configuration options for character, environment, and secrets. This involved refactoring ElizaOS/Server to integrate these new core functionalities. ([elizaos/eliza#6037](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6037))
- **Resolution of CLI Import Errors**: A critical issue where imports were not found in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61 was closed. The problem was identified as missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core@1.6.1`, a version-specific build/publish pipeline issue. Users are advised to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later. ([elizaos/eliza#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6031), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6031))
