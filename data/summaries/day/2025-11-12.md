On November 12, 2025, ElizaOS significantly enhanced its core framework by fixing a critical environment variable loading issue and integrating a new runtime reference for a unified messaging API. Concurrently, the documentation was expanded with a detailed tokenomics page, and the Solana plugin saw major improvements in testing infrastructure and TypeScript strictness, including a migration to Bun-centric testing.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Framework Enhancements
*   **Unified Messaging API & Runtime Reference**: A new ElizaOS reference was added within the runtime to support a unified messaging API, involving updates across several core packages. ([elizaos/eliza#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111))
*   **Environment Variable Loading Fix**: A bug fix was implemented to correctly load environment variables from `process.env`, resolving issues where agents failed to retrieve settings when variables were exported directly on the host. ([elizaos/eliza#6141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6141))

### Documentation Expansion
*   **Tokenomics Page Added**: A new comprehensive tokenomics page, detailing contract addresses and vesting information, was added to the documentation and integrated into the sidebar navigation. ([elizaos/docs#80](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/80))

### Plugin Development & Testing Improvements
*   **Solana Plugin Testing & Type Checking**: The Solana plugin migrated to a Bun-centric strict TypeScript environment with pre-build typechecking, including enabling typechecks in the build process, implementing stricter TypeScript rules, removing Node.js-specific types, and migrating the testing framework from Vitest to Bun test. Configuration guard tests were also added, and SOL swap handling was improved. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/22))
