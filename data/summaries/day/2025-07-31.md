On July 31, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress in core framework adaptability with new character-level model configurations and a revitalized TEE Starter Project, alongside a major documentation overhaul. Critical bug fixes were also deployed in the `plugin-evm` to resolve building errors affecting core functionalities.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **CLI Tooling and Dependency Management**: Two new issues in `elizaos/eliza` ([#5695](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5695), [#5696](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5696)) highlight potential problems with CLI commands and dependency resolution that need investigation.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Framework Enhancements
- **Enhanced Model Configuration**: A new feature in `elizaos/eliza` allows model parameters to be configured at the character level, providing more flexibility than hardcoded plugin settings, improving the adaptability of AI architectures. ([elizaos/eliza#5686](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5686))
- **TEE Starter Project Revitalization**: The TEE Starter Project in `elizaos/eliza` received a crucial update, fixing its broken development experience and ensuring developers can now properly utilize this foundational project. ([elizaos/eliza#5683](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5683))

### Documentation & Stability
- **Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul**: A major restructuring and cleanup of the ElizaOS documentation in `elizaos/eliza` were completed, removing the old Docusaurus-based structure and implementing a new, more organized layout to significantly improve clarity and accessibility. ([elizaos/eliza#5694](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5694))
- **EVM Plugin Build Error Resolution**: A critical building error impacting `src/actions/bridge.ts`, `src/actions/swap.ts`, `src/actions/transfer.ts`, and `src/providers/wallet.ts` in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm` was fixed, ensuring the stability and functionality of key EVM plugin operations.
