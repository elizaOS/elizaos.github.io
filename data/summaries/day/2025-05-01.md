On May 1, 2025, the ElizaOS project significantly enhanced its core framework by introducing API key authentication and custom embedding support, while also improving performance through model optimization and codebase simplification. Several long-standing bugs related to API key handling and agent responsiveness were resolved, though a new issue concerning text embedding delegation emerged.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#4418](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4418): Investigate an error message indicating no handler found for the delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING with OpenAI.
