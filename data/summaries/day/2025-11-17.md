On Nov 17, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in dependency modernization with the migration of `@elizaos/core` from an older LangChain version to `@langchain/textsplitters` v1.0, resolving a critical deprecation issue. Concurrently, enhancements were made to the `plugin-knowledge` to expose available documents as a state value for improved prompt binding, while discussions around DeepSeek API integration emerged across both `eliza` and `plugin-knowledge` repositories.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#6156](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6156): A user inquired about Deepseek API integration, with a maintainer suggesting `plugin-openrouter` as a confirmed method, requiring further input on direct OpenAI compatibility.
    - [elizaos/eliza#6156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6156): Discussion around DeepSeek API integration suggests using `plugin-openrouter` or potentially the OpenAI plugin if DeepSeek is OpenAI compatible, needing further clarification on the preferred approach.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Dependency Modernization & Compatibility
- Migrated the `@elizaos/core` package from LangChain v0.3 to `@langchain/textsplitters` v1.0, replacing the `langchain` dependency and updating import paths, which also removed outdated LangChain resolutions from plugin starter packages. ([elizaos/eliza#6152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6152))

### Plugin Enhancements
- Exposed available documents as a state value for easier prompt binding within the `plugin-knowledge` documents provider, enhancing it to return formatted available documents with count via new `values` fields and updating error handling.
