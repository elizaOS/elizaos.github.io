On November 5, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused on enhancing runtime flexibility within the `elizaos/eliza` repository by introducing an option to skip plugin migrations during initialization, alongside critical bug fixes for PostgreSQL entity serialization to ensure robust data handling. A new pull request was also opened to correct type paths in the `plugin-sql` package.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Runtime Enhancements
*   **Enhanced Runtime Control**: Added an optional `skipMigrations` parameter to the `initialize()` method in the `IAgentRuntime` interface, allowing conditional skipping of plugin migrations during runtime initialization, providing greater control over the startup process. ([elizaos/eliza#6132](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6132))

### Data Handling & Persistence Fixes
*   **PostgreSQL Entity Serialization Fixes**: Resolved entity creation failures in PostgreSQL by normalizing the `names` field to ensure it is always a proper array before database operations, including converting `Set` objects to arrays. ([elizaos/eliza#6133](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6133))
