On Feb 19, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in enhancing the Eliza framework, particularly with character management and API key support, alongside crucial documentation improvements. Several new issues emerged concerning client-server interaction and documentation clarity, highlighting areas for immediate attention.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#3592](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/3592): `pnpm start:client` is not fetching `localhost:3000`, indicating a potential client-server connection issue that needs investigation.
    - [elizaos/eliza#3596](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/3596): A key error in AppSidebar related to rendering SkeletonItem suggests a need for unique keys in map functions to prevent rendering issues.
    - [elizaos/eliza#3604](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/3604): Unclear README documentation in the client-direct package requires clarification to align with plugin functionalities.
