Today, the project expanded its plugin capabilities by integrating a self-hosted Farcaster plugin in the registry, reducing external API dependencies. Concurrently, the Eliza application refined its user experience for plugin selection and initiated planning for enhanced agent creation and web search functionalities.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Plugin Ecosystem Enhancements
*   A new `plugin-farcaster-local-hub` was integrated into the registry, enabling self-hosted Farcaster functionality and removing dependencies on external APIs ([elizaos-plugins/registry#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).
### User Experience Improvements
*   Visual feedback for plugin selection in Eliza was improved by implementing a full background color change ([elizaos/eliza#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).
*   The plugin selection mechanism in Eliza was enhanced with a toggle selection behavior, replacing the previous plus button functionality ([elizaos/eliza#6236](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6236)).
