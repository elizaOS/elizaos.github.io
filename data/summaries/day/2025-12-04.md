Today's development focused on enhancing the ElizaOS core with a unified API for serverless Node.js environments, alongside critical bug fixes that improved example stability and the SQL plugin's functionality. A new pull request was opened to refine response detection logic, while a new issue highlighted the need for automatic directory creation for the SQL plugin.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#6204](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6204): This new issue highlights a critical requirement for the `plugin-sql` to auto-create its `.eliza` directory to prevent crashes, requiring immediate attention to prevent user friction.

## ✅ Completed Work
- **Core API & Serverless Enhancements**:
    - Unified the API for serverless Node.js environments, streamlining development and deployment processes within ElizaOS. ([elizaos/eliza#6201](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6201))
- **Stability & Plugin Improvements**:
    - Ensured the `standalone-cli-chat` example correctly respects the user's `LOG_LEVEL` setting, improving example reliability. ([elizaos/eliza#6203](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6203))
    - Migrated examples from the deprecated `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` event system to the new `messageService.handleMessage()` API, modernizing the codebase.
    - Improved the SQL plugin's directory handling, including auto-creation of PGLite directories, enhancing its robustness. ([elizaos/eliza#6202](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6202))
