On November 1, 2025, the ElizaOS project enhanced agent stability by fixing a critical bug in `elizaos/eliza` that prevented settings from persisting across restarts. Plugin development saw updates with `plugin-mcp` refining action names and updating dependencies, while `plugin-openrouter` expanded model support and a new Solana Trading Insights plugin was added to the `elizaos-plugins/registry`.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Agent Stability and Core Updates
*   Fixed a bug in `elizaos/eliza` where agent settings were not persisting across restarts, resolving issues with lost runtime-generated configurations by modifying core runtime initialization logic for agent settings merge. ([elizaos/eliza#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106))
*   In `elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp`, the `CALL_TOOL` action was renamed to `CALL_MCP_TOOL` and `READ_RESOURCE` to `READ_MCP_RESOURCE`, maintaining backward compatibility. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/18))
*   The `@elizaos/core` dependency in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp` was updated to version ^1.5.4, aligning the plugin with the latest core framework improvements. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/18))
