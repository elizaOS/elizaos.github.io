Today's focus was on enhancing the stability and reliability of the ElizaOS framework through critical bug fixes, including improvements to CLI compilation, npm package publishing, and agent action refinement. Additionally, a new plugin was submitted to the registry, and discussions began around expanding agent capabilities with native web fetching.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Framework Stability and Publishing Fixes
*   **CLI Stability and Build Process Improvements**: Addressed TypeScript compilation errors during the build process for scenario commands, improving the CLI's stability and development experience ([elizaos/eliza#5887](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5887)).
*   **Registry and Publishing Enhancements**: Resolved a bug in `npmPackage` field construction, ensuring `elizaos publish` correctly adds packages to the registry without malformed entries ([elizaos/eliza#5882](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5882)).
*   **Agent Action Refinement**: Fixed an issue in the `plugin-bootstrap` package where image generation now correctly uses the user's request instead of the agent's profile, leading to more accurate outputs ([elizaos/eliza#5888](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5888)).
