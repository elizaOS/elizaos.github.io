Today, ElizaOS significantly expanded its AI capabilities by integrating Google Generative AI and improved CLI performance through lazy loading. The client UI received substantial enhancements for agent settings and responsiveness, while core system stability was boosted with extensive bug fixes and code cleanup. A new "kudo" plugin was added to the registry, and critical guidance was provided for the `elizaos update` command.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#4924](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4924) The web client continues to display an incorrect version number, triggering update banners and causing confusion, despite previous attempts to resolve it.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5216](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5216) The `sendAgentResponseToBus` function is not emitting the `EventType.MESSAGE_SENT` event, which could impact central server API communication.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5218) Inconsistent `bun run test` behavior across packages is leading to unreliable test execution and an inconsistent developer experience.
