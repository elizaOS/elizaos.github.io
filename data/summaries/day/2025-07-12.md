On July 12, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused on enhancing its testing infrastructure with the introduction of a new `@elizaos/test-utils` package, centralizing mock runtime utilities to improve testability across core and plugin modules. A critical issue preventing the creation of the Twitter Client was successfully resolved, though discussions continue regarding Twitter API rate limits and timeline fetching.

## üö® Needs Attention
