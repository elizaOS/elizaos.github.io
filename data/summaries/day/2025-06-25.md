ElizaOS significantly advanced agent capabilities today by implementing agent-scoped plugins for enhanced flexibility and completing the migration to `@elizaos/api-client`. Critical bug fixes improved chat stability and API documentation, while new development workflows were integrated.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5260): Custom plugin development challenges, specifically regarding agent processing only one message and UI display issues, require input on response handling (callback vs. return).
    - [elizaos/eliza#29](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/29) and [elizaos/eliza#26](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/26): Twitter plugin issues (not posting replies, newline formatting) need further investigation into response delivery and template behavior.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Agent Core & API Client Refinement
- **Enhanced Agent Plugin Management**: Refactored plugin architecture from project-scoped to agent-scoped, allowing unique plugin sets per agent for greater flexibility. ([elizaos/eliza#5270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5270))
- **API Client Migration & Documentation**: Completed migration of `packages/client` to `@elizaos/api-client`, restoring GUI chat title generation and updating API documentation. ([elizaos/eliza#5263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5263), [elizaos/eliza#5280](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5280), [elizaos/eliza#5275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5275))

### Chat Stability & Development Workflow
- **Chat Stability Improvements**: Fixed issues causing chat to get stuck on "agent is thinking" and improved attachment formatting for better message display. ([elizaos/eliza#5274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5274), [elizaos/eliza#5273](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5273))
- **New Development Workflow**: Integrated a GitHub Actions workflow for Claude Code, introducing an AI coding agent to assist with repository development. ([elizaos/eliza#5269](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5269))

### Infrastructure & Plugin Configuration
- **Wallet Address Ingestion Optimization**: Improved wallet address ingestion speed by implementing batched GraphQL requests and migrating fetching to pipelines. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#134](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/134), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#132](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/132), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#130](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos/issues/130))
- **GitHub Data Fetching Refactor**: Removed `githubService` and integrated its functionality into `github.ts` for centralized and maintainable GitHub data interactions. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#132](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/132), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#133](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/133))
