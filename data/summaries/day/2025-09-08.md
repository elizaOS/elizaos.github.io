ElizaOS saw significant progress today with critical bug fixes and enhancements across core components and plugins. Key achievements include improved logging, enhanced security through dependency management, and the resolution of several long-standing CI/CD and UI issues. Discussions continued on integrating new AI providers, with existing workarounds highlighted.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**: Discussion continues on [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#5820](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5820), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm#5820](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5820), and [elizaos/eliza#5820](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5820) regarding "Feature: Native Venice AI Provider Integration"; input is needed to determine if the suggested workarounds (modifying base URL or using `plugin-venice`) are sufficient or if a direct native integration is still desired.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core System Stability & Security
- **Enhanced Logging and API Stability**: Refined logging to capture all agent logs and adjusted log levels for `SECRET_SALT` validation, improving system observability and reducing confusion. API routes for plugins were also namespaced for better organization and security. ([elizaos/eliza#5900](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5900), [elizaos/eliza#5895](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5895), [elizaos/eliza#5894](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5894), [elizaos/eliza#5893](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5893), [elizaos/eliza#5693](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5693))
- **Dependency Security**: Implemented NPM safe overrides to proactively pin `package.json` versions, specifically addressing a potential vulnerability related to the `error-ex` package, enhancing the project's security posture. ([elizaos/eliza#5904](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5904))
- **Routine Maintenance**: `plugin-evm` underwent a routine maintenance update, bumping the version to 1.0.13 and updating various dependencies to ensure stability. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/22))

### Feature Enhancements & UI/UX Improvements
- **EVM Transfer Functionality**: Added support for an optional `data` parameter within the `plugin-evm` transfer template, allowing for more flexible transaction configurations. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/16))
- **Chat UI Enhancements**: The feature to show action called and result in the chat UI was completed across multiple repositories, improving user feedback. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#5831](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5831), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm#5831](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5831), [elizaos/eliza#5831](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5831))

### Documentation & Project Setup
- **Documentation Improvements**: Added a comprehensive `AGENTS.md` contributor guide and addressed issues related to web UI dashboard documentation, streamlining project understanding. ([elizaos/eliza#5898](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5898), [elizaos/eliza#5899](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5899), [elizaos/eliza#5897](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5897), [elizaos/eliza#5677](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5677), [elizaos/eliza#5857](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5857))
- **CI/CD and Dockerization**: Resolved issues related to CLI CI tests and completed the task to dockerize `project-starter` across repositories, improving development setup and testing reliability. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#5714](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5714), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#5842](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5842), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm#5714](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5714), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm#5842](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5842), [elizaos/eliza#5714](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5714), [elizaos/eliza#5842](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5842))
