Today, ElizaOS saw significant progress in plugin expansion with the addition of `plugin-coti`, alongside critical security and stability enhancements to the `plugin-training` module. A major recurring user support issue concerning Google API integration was definitively resolved across multiple repositories, and new initiatives for documentation and video production were launched.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
