On October 12, 2025, ElizaOS saw a significant architectural shift with the `eliza` CLI deployment system migrating to a bootstrapper architecture, promising faster deployments and reduced resource usage. Concurrently, the `plugin-anthropic` repository underwent substantial refactoring to improve modularity and resolved critical TypeScript compilation issues.

## âœ… Completed Work
### Core System Enhancements
*   The ElizaOS CLI deployment system was completely migrated from Docker image builds to a bootstrapper architecture, expected to significantly improve deployment speed and reduce resource usage. ([elizaos/eliza#6058](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6058))

### Plugin Architecture & Stability
*   The `plugin-anthropic`'s monolithic `index.ts` file was split into a more modular directory structure with new `models/`, `providers/`, and `utils/` directories, enhancing organization and scalability. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic#9](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/9))
*   TypeScript compilation errors related to `process.env` usage in `plugin-anthropic` were resolved by adding `@types/node` as a devDependency and configuring `tsconfig.json`. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/10))
