On October 12, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw a significant architectural shift with the `elizaos/eliza` repository migrating its CLI deployment system to a bootstrapper architecture, aiming for faster deployments and reduced resource usage. Concurrently, the `elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic` repository underwent substantial refactoring to improve modularity and resolved critical TypeScript compilation errors.

### Core System Enhancements
- The ElizaOS CLI deployment system in `elizaos/eliza` was completely migrated from Docker image builds to a bootstrapper architecture, which is expected to improve deployment speed and reduce resource consumption. ([elizaos/eliza#6058](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6058))

### Plugin Architecture & Stability
- The `elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic` repository had its monolithic `index.ts` file split into a modular directory structure with dedicated `models/`, `providers/`, and `utils/` directories, enhancing organization and scalability. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic#9](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/9))
- TypeScript compilation errors related to `process.env` usage in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic` were resolved by adding `@types/node` as a devDependency and updating `tsconfig.json` to include Node.js type definitions.
