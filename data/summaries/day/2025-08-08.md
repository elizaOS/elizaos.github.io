ElizaOS made significant progress on code quality and build system enhancements today, including comprehensive formatting, dependency standardization, and migration to `bunx`. Critical bug fixes were implemented for XML parsing and logging. However, persistent build failures in `@elizaos/core` and the Eliza CLI remain a blocking concern, impacting testing and project creation across multiple plugins.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:
    - **Build Failure in @elizaos/core**: Progress on advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading is blocked due to TypeScript errors during the DTS build in `@elizaos/core`. This affects `elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp` ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5738)), `elizaos/eliza` ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738)), and `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge` ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5738)).
    - **Eliza CLI Build Failure**: The ElizaOS CLI fails to build projects due to missing placeholders in `logger.info` calls, impacting `elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp` ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5734)), `elizaos/eliza` ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734)), and `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge` ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5734)).
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - **Build Failure in @elizaos/core**: The latest comment from monilpat confirms the issue exists on the latest branch and was identified during a morning call, requiring immediate attention to unblock testing ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5738)).
    - **Eliza CLI Build Failure**: Discussion around this issue suggests it might be fixed in version 1.4.x, but confirmation and potential backporting or immediate fix are needed ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5734)).

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Codebase Refinement and Standardization
- Comprehensive code formatting and linting improvements were implemented across the ElizaOS codebase to enhance quality and consistency ([elizaos/eliza#5740](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5740)).
- Obsolete `llms.txt` was removed, and all internal package dependencies were standardized to use the workspace protocol, streamlining dependency management ([elizaos/eliza#5744](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5744)).
### Build System and XML Parser Enhancements
- GitHub workflows were updated to migrate from `npx` to `bunx` for lerna commands, improving efficiency ([elizaos/eliza#5742](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5742)).
- A critical bug fix replaced an unsafe XML fallback regex with a linear scan to prevent potential issues in the XML parser ([elizaos/eliza#5741](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5741)).
### Logging and Type Safety Improvements
- Logger calls across the repository were converted to object-first structured logging to align with pino typings, fixing TypeScript and DTS errors and improving type-safety and log structure ([elizaos/eliza#5737](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5737)).
- Error logging was standardized throughout `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge` for improved consistency and readability ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/38)).
