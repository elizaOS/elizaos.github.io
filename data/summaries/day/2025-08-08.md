On Aug 8, 2025, the ElizaOS project made significant strides in codebase refinement, standardizing dependencies, and enhancing build systems, including a migration to `bunx`. Critical logger compatibility issues were addressed across multiple repositories, though a persistent build failure in `@elizaos/core` and the Eliza CLI continues to block testing and project creation.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Blocked Issue: Build Failure in @elizaos/core:** [elizaos/eliza#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738) and [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5738) and [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738) This issue, confirmed to exist on the latest branch, is blocking testing of advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading.
- **Blocked Issue: Eliza CLI Project Build Failure:** [elizaos/eliza#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734) and [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5734) and [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734) This issue, related to missing logger placeholders, is still active and potentially fixed in an upcoming version.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Codebase Refinement & Standardization
- **Comprehensive Code Formatting and Linting:** Improved code quality, consistency, and maintainability across the ElizaOS codebase. [elizaos/eliza#5740](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5740)
- **Dependency Standardization:** Standardized all internal package dependencies to use the workspace protocol and removed obsolete `llms.txt`. [elizaos/eliza#5744](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5744)

### Build System & Core Enhancements
- **Migration to `bunx`:** Improved build efficiency by migrating GitHub workflows and package scripts from `npx` to `bunx`. [elizaos/eliza#5742](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5742)
- **XML Parser Enhancement:** Replaced an unsafe fallback regex with a linear scan in the XML parser to prevent potential issues. [elizaos/eliza#5741](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5741)

### Logging System & Compatibility Fixes
- **Pino Logger Refactor:** Addressed missing pino logger refactors, converting logger calls to object-first structured logging to align with pino typings and resolve TS/DTS errors. [elizaos/eliza#5737](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5737)
- **Logger Compatibility Fix in `plugin-knowledge`:** Standardized error logging across the application for improved consistency and readability. [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/38)
