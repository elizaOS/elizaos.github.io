ElizaOS focused on significant foundational improvements today, enhancing user experience with client-side navigation and a modernized README, while resolving critical plugin schema and CI test issues. A substantial number of new issues were opened, outlining future development across core API, message bus, and frontend integration, signaling a strategic push towards refining the agent framework's architecture and developer experience.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
*   **User Experience & Client Functionality**
    *   The `README.md` was modernized with a better structure and quick start guide, improving the initial experience for new users ([elizaos/eliza#5896](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5896)).
    *   URL synchronization was added for DM channel switching and direct navigation in the client, allowing users to bookmark and share specific conversation links ([elizaos/eliza#5941](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5941)).
    *   A bug was fixed in the client to remove a redundant `navigate()` call in the force new chat flow, resolving URL inconsistency issues ([elizaos/eliza#5945](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5945)).
*   **Prompt and Action Refinements**
    *   Action names were corrected and prompts improved for multi-step processes, enhancing the clarity and effectiveness of agent interactions ([elizaos/eliza#5942](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5942)).
