Today, the ElizaOS project made significant strides in enhancing its testing and reporting infrastructure, with a strong focus on comprehensive data collection, analysis, and visualization for scenario testing. Key achievements include the implementation of a robust reporting command with dynamic HTML and PDF export, standardization of evaluation output, and the completion of the scenario matrix configuration and run orchestration systems.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Enhanced Scenario Testing and Evaluation Framework
*   Completed the design and implementation of the scenario matrix configuration schema, including YAML definition, TypeScript interfaces, and robust validation, providing a structured way to define test matrices ([elizaos/eliza#5778](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5778)).
*   Implemented the `elizaos scenario matrix` CLI command, enabling basic parsing and validation of scenario matrix configuration files, crucial for initiating matrix test runs ([elizaos/eliza#5779](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5779)).
*   Developed the core logic for the parameter override system, including the `MatrixCombination` interface, `generateMatrixCombinations` function, and Cartesian product generation, allowing for dynamic modification of scenarios based on matrix parameters ([elizaos/eliza#5780](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5780)).
*   Implemented a standardized `EvaluationResult` interface and refactored evaluators to produce structured JSON output, enhancing the detail and usability of evaluation results ([elizaos/eliza#5783](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5783)).
*   Introduced the ability to define scenario capabilities within the LLM judge evaluation schema, allowing for more targeted and relevant assessments of agent performance ([elizaos/eliza#5784](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5784)).
*   Implemented a non-invasive method for logging agent trajectories, capturing thought, action, and observation steps for detailed post-run analysis ([elizaos/eliza#5785](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5785)).
*   Established a centralized schema (`ScenarioRunResult`) and utility (`RunDataAggregator`) for collecting and serializing all run data, ensuring comprehensive and consistent data storage ([elizaos/eliza#5786](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5786)).

### Comprehensive Reporting and Data Visualization
*   Implemented the `elizaos report generate` CLI command to create detailed performance reports from scenario matrix run data, including data ingestion, validation, aggregation, and structured output generation ([elizaos/eliza#5787](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5787)).
*   Designed and built a self-contained HTML report template with a clear, hierarchical layout, modern styling, and placeholders for dynamic data, integrating Chart.js for visualization ([elizaos/eliza#5788](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5788)).
*   Enabled dynamic rendering of reports by injecting aggregated JSON data into the HTML template, populating DOM elements, generating charts (bar, grouped bar, pie), and rendering interactive tables with search functionality ([elizaos/eliza#5789](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5789)).
*   Added PDF export functionality for reports using Puppeteer, ensuring print-friendly styling and high-fidelity output from the generated HTML reports ([elizaos/eliza#5790](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5790)).

### CLI and Publisher Module Refinements
*   Improved TypeScript type safety and error logging within the publisher module, replacing generic types with specific interfaces ([elizaos/eliza#5796](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5796)).
*   Corrected comma placement logic in `publisher.ts` to ensure proper JSON formatting when adding entries to the registry's `index.json` file ([elizaos/eliza#5774](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5774)).
*   Addressed code formatting inconsistencies and updated dependencies across various packages, including `plugin-bootstrap` and `project-tee-starter` ([elizaos/eliza#5795](https://github.elizaos/eliza/pull/5795)).
