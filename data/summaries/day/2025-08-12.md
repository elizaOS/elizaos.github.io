Today's focus was heavily on enhancing the ElizaOS scenario testing framework, with significant progress made in implementing natural language agent interaction, dynamic plugin loading, and advanced mocking capabilities. Concurrently, the plugin registry saw improvements in metadata and the addition of new plugins, alongside critical bug fixes for compatibility.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Enhanced Scenario Testing Capabilities
*   Implemented natural language agent interaction and response validation for scenarios, enabling testing of agent behavior through natural language. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#5727](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5727), [elizaos/eliza#5727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5727))
*   Implemented plugin specification in scenario YAML files, allowing scenarios to declare required plugins for testing. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#5725](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5725), [elizaos/eliza#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725))
*   Enhanced the mocking system to support conditional responses based on input parameters and complex response structures with metadata. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/registry/issues/5726), [elizaos/eliza#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5726))

### Plugin Registry Improvements
*   Enhanced the registry generation process to include additional repository metadata, improving plugin discovery. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#198](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/198))
*   Added three new ElizaOS plugins (`@elizaos/plugin-clanker`, `@elizaos/plugin-defillama`, and `@eli`) to the registry. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#197](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/197))
*   Fixed critical issues in the registry generation script related to incorrect v1 compatibility detection and semver handling. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#199](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/199))

### Build System Updates
*   Updated the `checkout` action to version 5 in the build process, ensuring the use of the latest and most secure actions. ([elizaos/eliza#5762](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5762))
