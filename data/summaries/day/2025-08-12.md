Overall Project Summary for Aug 12, 2025:

Today's development significantly advanced ElizaOS's testing capabilities with the implementation of natural language agent interaction, dynamic plugin loading, and enhanced mocking, alongside critical bug fixes for the plugin registry's stability. New evaluators for LLM interactions were proposed, and three new plugins were integrated into the registry, expanding ElizaOS's functionality.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Enhanced Scenario Testing Capabilities
*   The implementation of natural language agent interaction and response validation was completed, enabling scenarios to test agent behavior through natural language. ([elizaos/eliza#5727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5727), [elizaos-plugins/registry#5727](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5727))
*   Plugin specification and dynamic loading were successfully implemented, allowing scenarios to declare required plugins and enabling dynamic loading. ([elizaos/eliza#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725), [elizaos-plugins/registry#5725](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5725))
*   Conditional mocking and complex response structures were implemented, enhancing the mocking system to support conditional responses based on input parameters and complex response structures with metadata. ([elizaos/eliza#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5726), [elizaos-plugins/registry#5726](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5726))

### Plugin Registry Enhancements and Stability
*   The registry generation process now includes additional repository metadata, making plugin discovery more informative. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#198](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/198))
*   Three new ElizaOS plugins were added to the registry: `@elizaos/plugin-clanker` for Clanker protocol integration, `@elizaos/plugin-defillama` for DeFiLlama data access, and another unnamed plugin. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#197](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/197))
*   Critical issues in the registry generation script related to incorrect v1 compatibility detection and semver handling were fixed, preventing crashes. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#199](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/199))

### Build System Updates
*   The `checkout` action for the build system was updated to version 5, ensuring the use of the latest and most secure action for repository checkout in workflows. ([elizaos/eliza#5762](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5762))
