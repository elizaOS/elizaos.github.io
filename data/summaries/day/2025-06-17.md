Today's focus was on critical bug fixes, particularly improving chat stability, resolving Windows compatibility issues for project loading, and enhancing JSON serialization robustness. A significant documentation guide for AI assistants was also added, and a new plugin was proposed for the registry, while a long-standing knowledge management issue was confirmed resolved.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**: 
    - [elizaos/eliza#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5017): The issue regarding plugin action callbacks not reaching the user response is still active, with requests for users to perform clean installations and verify fixes for `plugin-evm` and `plugin-mcp`.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5155](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5155): Windows project loading issues due to `import()` not using the `file://` prefix need immediate attention.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5161): The `elizaos start` command crashing on Windows after accessing `localhost:3000` is a critical blocker for Windows users.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Core Stability & Compatibility Fixes**:
    - Fixed message filtering to correctly scope messages to the current chat/channel, preventing cross-chat display issues ([elizaos/eliza#5149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5149)).
    - Resolved GUI freezing when an agent ignored a user or sent an empty response ([elizaos/eliza#5151](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5151)).
    - Addressed a critical bug preventing project loading on Windows machines ([elizaos/eliza#5156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5156)).
    - Implemented a fix to prevent infinite recursion in the JSON sanitizer by handling circular references ([elizaos/eliza#5152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5152)).
- **Agent Prompting & Codebase Refinements**:
    - Removed unnecessary evaluator choices from the `messageHandler` prompt, streamlining agent decision-making ([elizaos/eliza#5148](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5148)).
    - Refactored the codebase by removing OpenTelemetry instrumentation from socket message processing ([elizaos/eliza#5153](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5153)).
- **Documentation & Knowledge Management**:
    - Added a comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` file providing detailed guidance for AI assistants on project architecture and workflow ([elizaos/eliza#5158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5158)).
    - The knowledge management (RAG) functionality issue was resolved and confirmed working in version 1.0.9 ([elizaos/eliza#5004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5004), [elizaos-plugins/registry#5004](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5004)).
