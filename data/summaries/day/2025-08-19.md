Today, a major milestone was achieved with the successful implementation and closure of the "Run Orchestration & Isolation" feature across both `elizaos/eliza` and `elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter`, significantly enhancing scenario testing capabilities. Core module enhancements in `elizaos/eliza` also introduced cross-environment logger support and critical fixes for the Phala CLI. An emerging challenge is the reported instability of the Twitter discovery service, experiencing periodic 503 errors.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Discovery Service Instability**: [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter#41](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/41) A new issue reports that the Twitter discovery service periodically returns 503 errors, occurring approximately 25% of the time, requiring investigation.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core System Enhancements & Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Logger Module Refactoring**: [elizaos/eliza#5797](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5797) Comprehensive refactoring of the logger module was introduced to support both browser and Node.js environments, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and an enhanced architecture.
- **Phala CLI and TEE Starter Fixes**: [elizaos/eliza#5773](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5773) Issues with Phala CLI argument handling and the TEE starter Docker build were resolved, which were preventing the `tee` command from functioning as intended.

### Advanced Run Orchestration & Isolation
