ElizaOS made significant strides today, focusing on enhancing the core framework's modularity and scalability through new features like improved plugin management and multi-tenancy support. Key efforts included resolving PGlite migration issues and refactoring server code for better performance, alongside addressing several critical bugs and memory challenges.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#3664](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3664): "JavaScript heap out of memory" error during knowledge/message processing requires immediate investigation into memory management.
    - [elizaos/eliza#3661](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3661): Docker file issue related to invalid cache store needs attention to prevent deployment problems.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Framework Enhancements & Scalability
- Implemented a new `agent` table and renamed the `user` table to `entity` to support multi-tenancy and future scalability within the ElizaOS framework ([elizaos/eliza#3637](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3637)).
- Added middleware settings for agent server options, providing developers with more control over server behavior ([elizaos/eliza#3648](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3648)).
- Cleaned up server code to enhance maintainability and performance ([elizaos/eliza#3667](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3667)).
- Refactored memory queries and knowledge metadata to improve system architecture and flexibility ([elizaos/eliza#3606](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3606)).

### Plugin Management & CLI Improvements
- Introduced a feature to check and display installed plugins when using the CLI, enhancing user experience and visibility ([elizaos/eliza#3660](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3660)).
- Resolved multiple issues related to the TON Plugin, including batch transfer processing, wallet creation, and historical token price data retrieval, significantly enhancing its functionality ([elizaos/eliza#3043](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3043), [elizaos/eliza#3042](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3042), [elizaos/eliza#3032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3032), [elizaos/eliza#3031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3031), [elizaos/eliza#2984](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/2984)).

### Bug Fixes & System Stability
- Resolved issues with PGlite migrations, ensuring a code-first approach for SQL across the system ([elizaos/eliza#3672](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3672)).
- Fixed setup dimensions before starting the client, improving initialization processes ([elizaos/eliza#3668](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3668)).
- Addressed various minor bugs, including speaker removal in Twitter spaces and typographical errors in documentation ([elizaos/eliza#3662](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3662), [elizaos/eliza#3656](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3656)).
