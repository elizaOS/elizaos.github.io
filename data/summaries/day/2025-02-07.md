On Feb 7, 2025, the ElizaOS project significantly advanced its core framework by transitioning from pnpm to Bun for enhanced performance and implementing a generic model loading system with OpenAI-compatible endpoints. Key dependency and build issues were resolved, improving compatibility and stability across the system. The team also expanded integration capabilities by supporting the Anthropic provider.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:
    - Missing `cors` and `multer` dependencies in `@elizaos/agent` are causing build issues, requiring immediate attention to resolve ([elizaos/eliza#3365](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3365)).
    - The `pnpm run dev --characters` command is not loading specified characters, defaulting to Eliza, which impacts character-specific development and testing ([elizaos/eliza#3362](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3362)).
    - The UI fails to load correctly when starting the service with a specific character file, hindering development and user experience ([elizaos/eliza#3360](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3360)).
