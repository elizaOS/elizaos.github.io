On July 18, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress in both frontend architecture and core framework stability. The `elizaos.github.io` repository underwent a major refactoring to support a multi-repository frontend and a substantial cleanup of legacy code, while the `eliza` repository focused on enhancing module resolution, fixing critical CLI bugs related to project creation, and general maintenance. These efforts collectively streamline development, improve reliability, and prepare the project for future modular expansion.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Frontend Architecture & Cleanup
*   **Multi-Repository Frontend Support**: A major update was implemented to support a multi-repository frontend, involving extensive changes across application components, queries, and utility functions, laying groundwork for a more modular UI. [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#143](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/143)
*   **Legacy Codebase Removal**: Outdated scripts and historical data were removed, including analysis, daily, and historical data files, along with associated legacy Python scripts, streamlining the project and reducing technical debt. [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#145](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/145)

### Core Framework Stability & Module Resolution
*   **Enhanced Module Resolution**: Improvements were made to the `ModuleLoader` system, ensuring consistent local-first module resolution, mirroring `server-manager.ts` guarantees, to improve reliability and predictability. [elizaos/eliza#5629](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5629)
*   **CLI Bug Fixes**: A critical bug preventing correct inheritance of `.elizadb` in nested project creation was resolved, improving the CLI's robustness. [elizaos/eliza#5618](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5618)
*   **General Maintenance**: A typo in `plugin.ts` was corrected, and a version bump to `v1.2.12` was performed across various packages. [elizaos/eliza#5632](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5632), [elizaos/eliza#5630](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5630)
