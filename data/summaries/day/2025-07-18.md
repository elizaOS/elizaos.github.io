Today, the ElizaOS project saw significant architectural improvements with a major refactoring of the `elizaos.github.io` frontend to support a multi-repository structure and extensive cleanup of legacy code. Concurrently, the core `eliza` framework enhanced its module resolution for greater consistency and fixed critical CLI bugs related to project creation and inheritance, improving overall stability and developer experience.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Frontend Architecture & Cleanup
*   **Multi-Repository Frontend Support**: Implemented a major update to support a multi-repository frontend, involving extensive changes across application components, queries, and utility functions, preparing for a more modular UI. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#143](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/143))
*   **Legacy Codebase Removal**: Removed outdated scripts and historical data, including analysis, daily, and historical data files, along with associated legacy Python scripts, reducing technical debt. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#145](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/145))

### Core Framework Stability & Module Resolution
*   **Enhanced Module Resolution**: Improved the `ModuleLoader` system to ensure consistent local-first module resolution, mirroring `server-manager.ts` guarantees, enhancing reliability. ([elizaos/eliza#5629](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5629))
*   **CLI Project Creation Fixes**: Resolved a critical bug preventing correct inheritance of `.elizadb` in nested project creation, improving the CLI's robustness. ([elizaos/eliza#5618](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5618))
*   **General Maintenance**: Corrected a typo in `plugin.ts` and performed a chore release `v1.2.12`. ([elizaos/eliza#5632](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5632), [elizaos/eliza#5630](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5630))
