The ElizaOS project saw significant progress today with the introduction of a new `generateText()` API in the core `eliza` repository, streamlining text generation, alongside the addition of a Moralis v2 plugin to the `registry`, expanding Web3 integration capabilities. Discussions around documentation links and new model provider integrations were also addressed, indicating a focus on both core functionality and ecosystem growth.
