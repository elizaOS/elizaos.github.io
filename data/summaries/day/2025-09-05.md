ElizaOS made significant strides today, enhancing AI agent testing with dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations and expanding the plugin ecosystem with ten new additions to the registry. Critical bug fixes improved logging and developer experience, while ongoing discussions address plugin visibility and build stability.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813): The issue of a published plugin not being visible in the registry requires clarification on the `npmPackage` field's scoping and the manual PR process for registry updates.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738): The build failure in `@elizaos/core` needs confirmation on whether it's truly resolved, as it was previously blocking complex scenario testing.
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#4921](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4921): The agent not responding to Twitter mentions needs an update on whether the issue persists after suggested CLI and `plugin-twitter` updates.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Enhanced AI Agent Testing & Evaluation**:
    - Dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations was implemented in ElizaOS scenarios, significantly improving the sophistication of testing and evaluation for AI agents, including new examples and extensive testing for conversation management ([elizaos/eliza#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)).
- **Developer Experience & Build Process Improvements**:
    - Improvements were made to the development workflow, including CLI fixes, logging cleanup, and file watching optimizations, enhancing the developer experience for monorepo setups ([elizaos/eliza#5881](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5881)).
    - Critical bug fixes were deployed for logging and environment configuration, resolving issues with JSON logging, excessive error logging for `SECRET_SALT`, and adding `SERVER_HOST` support for the `dev` command, reducing log noise and improving reliability ([elizaos/eliza#5885](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5885), [elizaos/eliza#5884](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5884), [elizaos/eliza#5883](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5883)).
- **Plugin Ecosystem Expansion**:
    - Ten new plugins were added to the registry, significantly increasing the available tools for ElizaOS agents ([elizaos-plugins/registry#228](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/228), [elizaos-plugins/registry#227](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/227), [elizaos-plugins/registry#226](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/226), [elizaos-plugins/registry#225](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/225), [elizaos-plugins/registry#224](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/224), [elizaos-plugins/registry#223](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/223), [elizaos-plugins/registry#222](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/222), [elizaos-plugins/registry#221](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/221), [elizaos-plugins/registry#220](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/220), [elizaos-plugins/registry#219](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/219)).
