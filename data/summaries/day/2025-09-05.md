ElizaOS made significant strides today in enhancing scenario testing with dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations, alongside numerous developer experience improvements and critical bug fixes for logging and configuration. The plugin registry also saw a substantial expansion with ten new additions, increasing the available tools for ElizaOS agents.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738): The `bun run clean` command continues to fail due to TypeScript errors in `@elizaos/core`, blocking testing of complex scenarios. `standujar` cannot reproduce, suggesting it might be fixed, but confirmation is needed.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813): A plugin successfully published to NPM is not visible in the PR, likely due to incorrect npm package scoping. A fix has been suggested to change `npmPackage` from `"plugin-delta"` to `"@1BDO/plugin-delta"`.
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#4921](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4921): The agent is not responding to Twitter mentions. `standujar` is asking if the issue persists after previous suggestions to update CLI and `plugin-twitter`.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Enhanced Scenario Testing**:
    - Dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations was implemented in ElizaOS scenarios, significantly improving the sophistication of testing with more complex and realistic conversational flows, including new examples and updated documentation. [elizaos/eliza#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)
- **Developer Experience & Stability Improvements**:
    - Improvements were made to the development workflow, including fixes for the CLI, logging cleanup, and file watching optimizations, particularly benefiting monorepo setups with client UIs. [elizaos/eliza#5881](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5881)
    - Critical bugs related to logging and environment configuration were resolved, fixing `LOG_JSON_FORMAT` issues, preventing excessive error logging for `SECRET_SALT`, and adding `SERVER_HOST` support to the `dev` command. [elizaos/eliza#5885](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5885), [elizaos/eliza#5884](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5884), [elizaos/eliza#5883](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5883)
- **Plugin Registry Expansion**:
    - Ten new plugins were added to the registry, significantly increasing the available tools for ElizaOS agents, including various "gorpy" and "jello" themed plugins. [elizaos-plugins/registry#228](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/228), [elizaos-plugins/registry#227](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/227), [elizaos-plugins/registry#226](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/226), [elizaos-plugins/registry#225](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/225), [elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/224), [elizaos-plugins/registry#223](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/223), [elizaos-plugins/registry#222](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/222), [elizaos-plugins/registry#221](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/221), [elizaos-plugins/registry#220](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/220), [elizaos-plugins/registry#219](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/219)
