On Dec 18, 2025, ElizaOS significantly advanced its core capabilities by enhancing streaming support for text generation across the framework and introducing new configuration options for the Anthropic plugin. Additionally, the Discord plugin saw major improvements in channel history and memory management, while the public website gained new user profile features and streamlined configuration.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Framework Enhancements
*   **Enhanced Streaming Capabilities for Text Generation**: A major feature was introduced to enhance streaming support for text generation models, providing an opt-in streaming API via a `stream: true` parameter, improving responsiveness across `core`, `server`, `client`, and `api-client` packages. ([elizaos/eliza#6212](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6212))
*   **CLI Test Runner Improvements**: Improvements were made to the CLI test runner, contributing to a more robust and efficient testing environment. ([elizaos/eliza#6212](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6212))

### Plugin Development
*   **Enhanced Anthropic Text Generation Configuration**: The Anthropic plugin now supports configurable CoT (Chain of Thought) budgets and the `topP` option for text generation models, providing more granular control. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/11))
*   **Enhanced Discord Channel History and Memory Management**: Implemented a Discord channel history spider with persisted state and centralized the process of building messages into memory. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#30](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/30))
*   **Improved Discord Attachment and Voice Processing**: Upgraded utilities for attachments and voice transcription, including better logging and chunking mechanisms. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#30](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/30))

### Website and Configuration Updates
*   **Enhanced User Profile Functionality**: A new feature was added to allow users to copy their profile data to LLMs, and the site's default name was updated to "HiScores." ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#183](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/183))
*   **Streamlined Configuration Management**: The site's `SITE_NAME` can now be configured directly from the pipeline config file, simplifying setup for forks. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#182](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/182))
*   **Repository Cleanup**: Various development-related files and directories were cleaned up, contributing to a more organized codebase. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#181](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/181))
