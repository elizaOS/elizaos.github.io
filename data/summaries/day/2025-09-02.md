Today's development focused on significant CLI and build system enhancements, including improved Docker integration for project starters and a new workflow for alpha NPM releases. A critical logger compatibility bug was fixed in `plugin-mcp`, and the chat UI now provides real-time action feedback. Ongoing discussions continue regarding the refactoring of the Eliza CLI to centralize business logic in the server package and delegate responsibilities.

## üö® Needs Attention
