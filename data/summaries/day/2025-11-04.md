Today, ElizaOS made significant strides in foundational infrastructure, with major developments in billing systems, authentication, and documentation across multiple repositories. Key achievements include the implementation of a comprehensive Stripe-backed billing subsystem, an automated container billing logic, and a new public documentation UI with an OpenAI-style API explorer. The team also focused on enhancing chat responsiveness, building out voice infrastructure, and designing an architecture for anonymous user support and free inference.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Billing and Payments Infrastructure
*   **elizaos-plugins/registry**: A full Stripe-backed billing subsystem was implemented, including new database tables, backend API routes, a TypeScript API client, and frontend components for the billing page ([#6123](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6123)).
*   **elizaos-plugins/registry**: A complete automated monthly container billing system was implemented, featuring new database schemas, a `BillingService` for cron jobs and payment processing, and new REST API endpoints ([#6124](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6124)).

### Documentation and User Interface Enhancements
*   **elizaos-plugins/registry**: A new public `/docs` UI was built, featuring an OpenAI-style API explorer, character setup guides, and an overview of the cloud architecture, including interactive endpoint testing and multi-language code examples ([#6128](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6128)).
*   **elizaos/spartan**: Documentation URLs were updated across various files, including `README.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/QUICKSTART.md`, and `package.json` ([elizaos/spartan#22](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/22)).
*   **elizaos/spartan**: Further documentation updates were made to several `README.md` and `DOCKER.md` files within the `docker/` and `docs/` directories ([elizaos/spartan#21](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/21)).

### Core System and Performance Improvements
*   **elizaos-plugins/registry**: Significant improvements were made to Eliza chat responsiveness and reliability, including a `ModelPerformanceMonitor`, smart timeout management, and adaptive retry logic ([#6127](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6127)).
*   **elizaos-plugins/registry**: A comprehensive voice infrastructure was implemented, supporting browser-based voice generation and optional server voice endpoints for premium users, along with integration for generating and searching embeddings from voice transcriptions ([#6130](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6130)).
*   **elizaos-plugins/registry**: An architecture document was created detailing the implementation of anonymous user IDs and a free inference tier, including a 4-tier user system, quota management, new database tables, and middleware for user identification and quota enforcement ([#6131](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6131)).
*   **elizaos/spartan**: Docker configurations were streamlined to simplify the development setup, involving changes to `.gitignore`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `docker/Dockerfile`, and `docker/mysql/init/init.sql` ([elizaos/spartan#20](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/20)).
*   **elizaos/spartan**: A large-scale x402 MCP implementation was introduced, affecting files within `spartan-mcp/`, including agent configurations, API handlers, cache, and logger components ([elizaos/spartan#16](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/16)).

### New Application Features
*   **elizaos/spartan**: A Farcaster miniapp is in progress, with numerous files added under `farcaster-miniapps/multichain-miniapp/` ([elizaos/spartan#19](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/19)).
*   **elizaos/spartan**: A new Chrome extension was added, utilizing existing routes and introducing new files under `chrome-extension/` ([elizaos/spartan#17](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/17)).
