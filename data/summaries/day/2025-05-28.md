On May 28, 2025, ElizaOS focused on refining server environment configurations, particularly `.env` file management for robust secret handling, and enhancing plugin flexibility with parameterized routes. Several critical issues were addressed, including a plugin integration problem, while new challenges emerged in end-to-end testing and CLI-less agent file execution.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Environment and Configuration Enhancements
*   Merged functionality to manually write the `.env` file to Fly.io and merge `process.env` variables, ensuring secrets are properly handled in server hosting environments ([elizaos/eliza#4808](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4808), [elizaos/eliza#4806](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4806)).

### Plugin and Routing Improvements
*   Introduced support for parameterized routes in plugins, enhancing routing capabilities ([elizaos/eliza#4817](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4817)).

### Testing and Stability Fixes
*   Fixed various typos and improved test configurations related to TEE tests ([elizaos/eliza#4816](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4816), [elizaos/eliza#4807](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4807)).
