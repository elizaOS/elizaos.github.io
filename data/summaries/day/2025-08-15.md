Today's focus was on resolving critical plugin publishing and testing issues across multiple repositories, significantly improving the reliability of the ElizaOS plugin ecosystem. Concurrently, core dependency updates were implemented, and a new pull request for streaming model integration was opened in `elizaos/eliza`, while `elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana` saw the addition of extensive new utility functions.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Plugin Publishing & Testing Reliability
*   Resolved critical issues where `elizaos publish --npm` reported false success due to incorrect package naming and outdated templates, ensuring reliable plugin distribution across `elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter`, `elizaos/eliza`, `elizaos-plugins/registry`, and `elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana`. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5754), [elizaos/eliza#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754), [elizaos-plugins/registry#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5754), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5754))
*   Addressed recurring test failures related to WebSocket mocking by providing guidance and implementing fixes to ensure mocks are correctly set up before imports, improving testing stability across `elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter`, `elizaos/eliza`, `elizaos-plugins/registry`, and `elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana`.

### Core System Enhancements
*   Updated `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` and resolved `bun run clean` and `bats-assert` dependency issues in `elizaos/eliza` to improve compatibility and maintainability. ([elizaos/eliza#5776](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5776))

### Plugin Capabilities Expansion
*   Added a comprehensive set of new utility functions to `elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana` for streamlined interactions with the Solana blockchain, including address identification, token account retrieval, and direct swap execution. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/10))
*   Refined `elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana`'s internal configuration to explicitly set the chain/service and rename it to `chain_solana`, improving clarity and consistency. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/8))
