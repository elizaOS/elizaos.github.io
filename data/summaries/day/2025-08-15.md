Today, the ElizaOS project significantly improved plugin stability and developer experience by resolving critical issues related to plugin publishing and testing across multiple repositories. Key updates included fixing false success reports for `elizaos publish --npm` and stabilizing WebSocket mocking for tests. Additionally, the `plugin-solana` saw substantial enhancements with new utility functions, while core dependencies were updated for better maintainability.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Plugin Publishing & Testing Stability
*   Resolved critical issues where `elizaos publish --npm` reported success but failed to publish plugins due to incorrect package naming and outdated templates, ensuring reliable plugin distribution. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5754), [elizaos/eliza#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754), [elizaos-plugins/registry#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5754), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5754))
*   Addressed recurring test failures related to WebSocket mocking by ensuring correct mock setup before imports, significantly improving test stability across plugins. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5770), [elizaos/eliza#5770](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5770), [elizaos-plugins/registry#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5770), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5770))

### Core System & Plugin Enhancements
*   Updated `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` and other dependencies in `elizaos/eliza` to improve compatibility and maintainability. ([elizaos/eliza#5776](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5776))
*   Enhanced `plugin-solana` with a comprehensive set of new utility functions for streamlined Solana blockchain interactions, including address identification, token account retrieval, and direct swap execution. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/10))
*   Refined the internal configuration of `plugin-solana` to explicitly set the chain/service and rename it to `chain_solana` for improved clarity. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/8))
