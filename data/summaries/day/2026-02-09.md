On February 9, 2026, ElizaOS saw significant progress in core infrastructure with enhancements to user session management and memory persistence, alongside key plugin and OAuth integrations. However, a critical URL processing bug and a Renovate configuration error emerged, requiring immediate attention.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#6488](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6488): An error in the Renovate configuration needs immediate attention as it will halt PRs.
    - [elizaos/eliza#6486](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6486): A bug where URLs in messages trigger duplicate LLM calls, leading to two responses, requires investigation.

## ✅ Completed Work
- **Core Infrastructure & User Management**:
    - User session isolation and memory persistence were enhanced, ensuring each user interaction creates an isolated agent instance and that conversation history and user preferences are remembered across sessions.
