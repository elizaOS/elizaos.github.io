On Jul 8, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in the `eliza` repository, primarily focusing on enhancing CLI usability and stability, addressing critical application bugs, and improving release workflows. Additionally, a new image generation action was integrated into the agent pipeline, and the plugin registry was updated with missing entries.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#5438](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5438) - The discussion on setting up a rate-limited Eliza hosted LLM and embedding endpoint is highly active, with a POC for fallback mechanisms completed and needing further review/integration.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Enhanced CLI Stability and User Experience
- Improved SPA routing for globally installed CLI installations, fixing refresh issues on non-home routes ([elizaos/eliza#5479](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5479), [elizaos/eliza#5477](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5477), [elizaos/eliza#5472](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5472), [elizaos/eliza#5469](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5469), [elizaos/eliza#5481](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5481)).
- Prevented global plugin installations to avoid permission issues and conflicts ([elizaos/eliza#5450](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5450)).
- Fixed Windows plugin loading and `dev` command failures by addressing path normalization ([elizaos/eliza#5437](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5437)).

### Critical Bug Fixes for Application Reliability
- Resolved React hydration errors and SPA routing issues, preventing UI glitches and warnings ([elizaos/eliza#5475](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5475)).
- Fixed "stream is not readable" server error by removing duplicate body parser ([elizaos/eliza#5458](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5458)).
- Prevented repeated DM channel creation on refresh by clearing `forceNew` state ([elizaos/eliza#5455](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5455)).

### Release Workflow and CI/CD Improvements
- Fixed failing release workflow and simplified post-publish steps, resolving Lerna publish failures due to uncommitted changes ([elizaos/eliza#5467](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5467), [elizaos/eliza#5466](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5466), [elizaos/eliza#5463](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5463)).
- Ensured correct version display in the client UI after releases by bumping versions in Lerna before build ([elizaos/eliza#5461](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5461)).

### New Features and UI Refinements
- Added a new `generateImageAction` to the agent pipeline, enabling image generation based on conversational context ([elizaos/eliza#5446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5446)).
- Replaced `window.confirm` usages with `useConfirmation` hook for consistent, theme-aware modal confirmations ([elizaos/eliza#5444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5444)).

### Plugin Registry Updates
- Added missing plugins from the BD list to the registry ([elizaos-plugins/registry#189](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/189)).
