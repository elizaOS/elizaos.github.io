On June 28, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw progress in standardizing the testing framework within the `eliza` repository by migrating to `bun:test`, and the `plugin-bonsai` was added to the `registry`. Other repositories, `auto.fun`, `plugin-solana`, and `plugin-knowledge`, had no activity.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Framework Enhancements
*   **Testing Framework Standardization**: The `eliza` repository migrated its testing framework from a mixed setup of `vitest` and `bun:test` to a unified `bun:test` framework, aiming for consistency and reduced maintenance overhead ([elizaos/eliza#5185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5185)).
*   **Plugin Loading Information Clarification**: An issue in `eliza` regarding how to check currently loaded plugins in a running agent was closed, with the solution indicating that plugin loading information is available in the agent's log output ([elizaos/eliza#4931](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4931)).

### Plugin Registry Updates
*   **New Plugin Added**: The `plugin-bonsai` was added to the `index.json` file in the `registry` repository, following established naming conventions and repository references ([elizaos-plugins/registry#181](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/181)).
