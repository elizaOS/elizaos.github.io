Today, significant progress was made on the `plugin-birdeye` with a major refactoring to a config-driven service architecture and a critical bug fix for task management, enhancing reliability. Concurrently, the core `eliza` repository saw a new pull request to align server tests with recent API changes and the initiation of a discussion for a Polymarket Plugin.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Plugin Architecture and Reliability Improvements
- The `plugin-birdeye` underwent a major refactoring to implement a config-driven service architecture, introducing `BirdeyeService` for initialization, wallet synchronization, and new providers with caching capabilities for various data points. This impacts numerous core files, providers, and action files. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye/pull/6))
- A bug in `plugin-birdeye` was fixed to ensure the cleanup of old tasks and registration of new `BIRDEYE_SYNC_WALLET` tasks are deferred until `runtime.initPromise` resolves, guaranteeing safer task scheduling.
