On December 2, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused heavily on refining the user experience and bolstering system stability, with significant UI simplifications and critical bug fixes for container deployment and server reliability.

## ✅ Completed Work
### UI/UX Enhancements and Simplification
*   User interface elements were streamlined by removing redundant information, relocating billing details, and simplifying the Generation Studio. ([#6174](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6174), [#6175](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6175), [#6176](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6176), [#6177](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6177), [#6179](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6179))
*   A distinct visual theme for "Build Mode" was implemented, and credit balances now clearly display the "$" symbol. ([#6179](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6179))

### Bug Fixes and System Stability
*   A critical bug preventing container deployment on specific architectures was resolved. ([#6187](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6187))
*   Server stability was improved by addressing concurrent connection timeouts and implementing reliability patterns, including proper Socket.IO configuration and HTTP server timeouts. ([#6198](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6198))
*   A pointer event issue affecting the "Dashboard" button was fixed. ([#6188](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6188))
