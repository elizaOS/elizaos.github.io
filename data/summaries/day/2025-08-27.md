Today, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in core stability and ecosystem expansion, with multiple bug fixes and build improvements in the `eliza` repository, the addition of a new plugin to the `registry`, and updates to repository tracking on `elizaos.github.io`.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Core Stability and Build Improvements
- Enhanced event handling by ensuring runtime inclusion in emitted events and introducing an `initPromise` property in `eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#5827](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5827)).
- Improved browser build exports and type definitions for the core package in `eliza`, resolving build issues and enhancing compatibility ([elizaos/eliza#5832](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5832)).
- Corrected `AgentLog` type structure and fixed action viewer mapping in the `eliza` client, addressing display issues ([elizaos/eliza#5834](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5834)).
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in the `plugin-bootstrap` package in `eliza` by correcting `logger.error` parameter order in the `imageGeneration` action ([elizaos/eliza#5833](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5833)).
- Made environment loading lazy in the `eliza` CLI to prevent warnings during startup, improving user experience ([elizaos/eliza#5829](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5829)).

### Ecosystem Expansion
- The `@standujar/plugin-composio` plugin was added to the public plugin registry, making it discoverable and available for use ([elizaos-plugins/registry#209](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/209)).
