On Aug 27, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress in core stability and ecosystem expansion. Key developments included bug fixes and type definition improvements across the `eliza` core, client, and plugin-bootstrap packages, alongside the addition of a new plugin to the registry and updates to repository tracking on the project website.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Core Stability & Type Definition Improvements
*   Enhanced event handling by ensuring runtime inclusion in emitted events and introducing an `initPromise` property in `eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#5827](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5827)).
*   Improved browser build exports and type definitions within the `eliza` core package, resolving build issues and enhancing compatibility ([elizaos/eliza#5832](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5832)).
*   Updated `AgentLog` type structure and fixed action viewer mapping in the `eliza` client for correct data representation ([elizaos/eliza#5834](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5834)).
*   Corrected `logger.error` parameter order in `imageGeneration` action within `eliza`'s `plugin-bootstrap` to resolve TypeScript compilation errors ([elizaos/eliza#5833](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5833)).

### Ecosystem Expansion & Infrastructure Updates
*   The `@standujar/plugin-composio` plugin was added to the public plugin registry, making it discoverable and available for use ([elizaos-plugins/registry#209](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/209)).
*   Added tracking for the `elizaos/docs` repository and implemented exclusion rules for the Claude bot on the project website ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#151](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/151)).

### CLI & Environment Handling Enhancements
*   Made environment loading lazy in the `eliza` CLI to prevent confusing warnings during startup, improving the user experience ([elizaos/eliza#5829](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5829)).
