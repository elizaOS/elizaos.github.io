On Oct 6, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused heavily on core framework stability and agent management, with significant refactoring of the ElizaOS/Server, migration to UUID-only agent identification, and critical bug fixes for plugin reloading and runtime initialization. An ongoing discussion regarding TypeScript import errors in Eliza CLI 1.61 highlights a key challenge needing resolution.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031) - The discussion on TypeScript import errors in Eliza CLI 1.61 continues, with detailed output provided by a user, suggesting a specific bug in version 1.6.1 that needs further investigation.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Framework Refactoring & Configuration
- Continued the multi-phase refactoring of the ElizaOS/Server, introducing dedicated config and plugin modules for improved modularity and scalability. [elizaos/eliza#6037](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6037)
- Added support for `SERVER_PORT` configuration, enhancing flexibility in deployment environments. [elizaos/eliza#6038](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6038)

### Agent and Plugin Stability
- Migrated to a UUID-only agent identification system, streamlining agent management and consistency. [elizaos/eliza#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036)
- Addressed a critical bug where agent plugins were not reloading correctly on `PATCH` updates and resolved a service stop race condition. [elizaos/eliza#6040](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6040)
- Fixed an issue in plugins to correctly use the `ZodError.issues` API instead of the deprecated `.errors`. [elizaos/eliza#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035)

### Runtime and Service Optimization
- Ensured that the runtime database is properly initialized before task access, preventing potential errors. [elizaos/eliza#6039](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6039)
- Implemented a fix to skip test execution for types-only packages within service interfaces, optimizing the build process. [elizaos/eliza#6034](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6034)
