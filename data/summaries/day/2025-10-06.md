## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Framework Refactoring & Configuration
- Continued the multi-phase refactoring of the ElizaOS/Server, integrating new config and plugin modules to enhance modularity and extensibility. [elizaos/eliza#6037](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6037)
- Added support for `SERVER_PORT` configuration, improving flexibility for deployment environments. [elizaos/eliza#6038](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6038)

### Agent & Plugin Stability
- Migrated to a UUID-only agent identification system, streamlining agent management and consistency. [elizaos/eliza#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036)
- Addressed a critical bug where agent plugins were not reloading correctly on `PATCH` updates and resolved a service stop race condition. [elizaos/eliza#6040](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6040)
- Fixed an issue in plugins to use the correct `ZodError.issues` API, ensuring proper error handling for invalid plugin configurations. [elizaos/eliza#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035)

### Runtime & Service Reliability
- Ensured that the runtime database is initialized before task access, preventing potential errors and improving task execution reliability. [elizaos/eliza#6039](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6039)
- Implemented a fix in service interfaces to skip test execution for types-only packages, optimizing the build process. [elizaos/eliza#6034](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6034)
