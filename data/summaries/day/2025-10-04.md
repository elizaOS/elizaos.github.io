On October 4, 2025, the primary focus was a significant refactoring effort within the `plugin-discord` repository to integrate the new `MentionContext` interface, which is dependent on a feature branch in the Eliza core. This refactoring aims to improve character name detection and involved core service and message handling files.

### Core Refactoring & Integration
*   A major refactoring was completed in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord` to adopt the new `MentionContext` interface, addressing fuzzy matching issues for character name detection. This involved modifications across `src/environment.ts`, `src/messages.ts`, `src/service.ts`, and test files.
