On Sep 3, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant infrastructure improvements in the `eliza` repository, including unified NPM release workflows, Bun updates, and enhanced CLI testing, alongside critical bug fixes. The `registry` repository received two new plugin submissions and continued discussions on plugin visibility and rate limiting documentation. The monorepo was bumped to version `1.5.5-alpha.1`.

## üö® Needs Attention 

- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:
    - [elizaos-plugins/registry#5813](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5813) / [elizaos/eliza#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813): This issue regarding a plugin not being visible in the registry after NPM publishing requires further investigation, as the user was advised to re-run `elizaos publish` without the `--npm` flag and potentially alter the plugin name.
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos-plugins/registry#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/40) / [elizaos/eliza#40](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/40): Clarification is needed on the documentation for rate limiting, specifically regarding the Basic Tier requirement to avoid errors, with a rate limiter now implemented.
