Today, ElizaOS saw significant infrastructure improvements in the `eliza` repository, including unified NPM release workflows and critical bug fixes, alongside continued expansion of the `registry` with new plugin submissions. A key focus across both repositories was addressing a user's issue regarding plugin visibility after publishing, highlighting the need for clearer documentation on the `elizaos publish` command's `--npm` flag.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos-plugins/registry#5813](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5813) / [elizaos/eliza#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813): A user's `plugin-delta` is not visible in the registry PR after publishing; requires clarification on `elizaos publish` usage without the `--npm` flag.
    - [elizaos-plugins/registry#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/40) / [elizaos/eliza#40](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/40): Clarification is needed in documentation regarding API rate limiting for different tiers, specifically concerning the monthly read limit.
