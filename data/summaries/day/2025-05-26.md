Overall Project Summary:
Today's development across ElizaOS focused on significant user experience enhancements, particularly within the Eliza framework, including improved knowledge management visualization and client chat interactions. Several critical API and client initialization issues were addressed, though some persistent challenges with the `/api/agents/:agentId/rooms` endpoint and Twitter client initialization have re-emerged, requiring further attention.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#4779](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4779): The `/api/agents/:agentId/rooms` endpoint is still returning an empty list despite the agent being active, indicating a regression or an unresolved underlying issue.
    - [elizaos/eliza#4777](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4777): Eliza is failing to initialize clients for Twitter, preventing tweet publication, which was previously marked as resolved.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **User Experience & Knowledge Management Improvements**:
    - The knowledge tab has been migrated to `plugin-knowledge`, and a graph view has been added to memories, enhancing data visualization and management within Eliza ([elizaos/eliza#4766](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4766)).
    - An animated "agent is thinking..." feature was introduced to improve user interaction during response generation in the client chat interface ([elizaos/eliza#4778](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4778)).
- **API and System Stability Fixes**:
    - The issue with the `/api/agents/:agentId/rooms` endpoint returning an empty list was addressed, ensuring accurate room data retrieval ([elizaos/eliza#4762](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4762)).
    - The problem with the `LOG_LEVEL` variable not functioning correctly was resolved, restoring expected logging behavior ([elizaos/eliza#4772](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4772)).
    - The issue preventing Eliza from initializing Twitter clients was closed, allowing for successful tweet publishing ([elizaos/eliza#4777](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4777)).
