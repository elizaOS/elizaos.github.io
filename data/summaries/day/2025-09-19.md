### CLI Stability and Core Logic Refactoring
- A crucial bug fix was implemented to prevent the `dev` mode from entering a port increment loop, ensuring a more stable and predictable development experience for the CLI. ([elizaos/eliza#5988](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5988))
- Extensive refactoring centralized business logic within the `server` package, significantly improving the modularity and maintainability of the codebase by consolidating core functionalities. ([elizaos/eliza#5864](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5864))
