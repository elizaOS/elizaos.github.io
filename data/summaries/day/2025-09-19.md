Today, ElizaOS significantly enhanced the `eliza` CLI's stability by resolving a critical dev server restart bug and undertook a major refactoring effort to centralize business logic within the `server` package, improving modularity and maintainability across the project. This strategic move aligns with our core philosophy of composability and sets a stronger foundation for future development.

### Core Logic Refactoring & Stability
*   **CLI Stability and Dev Server Fixes**: Resolved an issue in `elizaos/eliza` where the dev mode port increment loop occurred by ensuring the previous server port is released before restarting, enhancing the reliability of the development environment ([elizaos/eliza#5988](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5988)).
*   **Core Logic Centralization**: Undertook a major refactoring effort in `elizaos/eliza` to centralize business logic within the `server` package, moving it out of the `cli` package. This improves modularity, maintainability, and aligns with the project's core philosophy of composability ([elizaos/eliza#5864](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5864)).
