**Daily Project Summary: Aug 7, 2025**

Today, the ElizaOS project significantly advanced its monorepo and release workflows, addressing critical CLI stability issues, while also making substantial progress on advanced scenario features like natural language agent interaction and dynamic plugin loading, though these are currently blocked by a persistent plugin loading bug.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#5727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5727) Natural language agent interaction is complete but blocked by a plugin loading hang issue (#5719), preventing full testing.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725) Dynamic plugin parsing and validation are complete but blocked by the same plugin loading hang issue (#5719), preventing real-world testing.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Monorepo & Release Workflow Improvements
- Migrated to `workspace:*` versioning for improved dependency synchronization and consistency across packages ([elizaos/eliza#5731](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5731)).
- Refined the release workflow by removing automatic `main` to `develop` merges, providing more control ([elizaos/eliza#5732](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5732)).

### CLI Stability & Version Handling
- Fixed a critical bug in the CLI's `update` command related to monorepo version handling, ensuring consistent CI test passes ([elizaos/eliza#5733](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5733)).

### Scenario Runtime & Environment Fixes
- Resolved issues with scenario runtime dependency auditing and evaluators ([elizaos/eliza#5640](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5640)).
- Fixed an integration issue where environment providers were bypassing sophisticated logic ([elizaos/eliza#5639](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5639)).
- Addressed an environment variable parsing issue where quotes were not handled correctly ([elizaos/eliza#5590](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5590)).
