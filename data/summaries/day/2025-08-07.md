Today, ElizaOS focused heavily on refining core monorepo infrastructure, including dependency management and release workflows, alongside critical CLI stability fixes. Significant progress was also made on advanced scenario features like natural language agent interaction and dynamic plugin loading, though a persistent plugin loading bug is currently blocking their full integration and testing.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#5727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5727): Natural language agent interaction is complete but blocked by a plugin loading hang issue (#5719).
    - [elizaos/eliza#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725): Dynamic plugin parsing and validation are complete but blocked by the same plugin loading hang issue (#5719).
    - [elizaos/eliza#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5726): Conditional mocking and complex response structures are 85% complete, with remaining tasks focused on real-world service integration testing and validation.
