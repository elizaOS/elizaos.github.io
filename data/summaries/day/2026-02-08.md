ElizaOS saw major advancements today with the implementation of a comprehensive JWT authentication and user management system, significantly bolstering security and multi-entity support. Concurrently, plugin optimization efforts drastically improved agent intelligence by reducing prompt bloat through dynamic action filtering, while core plugins like EVM and Solana received substantial enhancements in RPC flexibility, API routing, and system refactoring.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Platform Enhancements & Security
- **elizaos/eliza**: Implemented a comprehensive JWT authentication and user management system with external provider support and data isolation, significantly enhancing security and multi-entity capabilities ([#6200](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6200)).
- **elizaos/eliza**: Optimized `plugin-bootstrap` with performance improvements, caching, and type safety, alongside adding null checks for `Object.entries` and `runtime.providers` to prevent runtime errors ([#6476](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6476), [#6473](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6473), [#6471](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6471)).
- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp**: Enhanced multi-tenant safety by eliminating shared-state mutations and implementing lazy HTTP connections for MCP, ensuring per-entity connections with correct API keys ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/24)).

### Agent Intelligence & Plugin Optimization
- **elizaos/eliza**: Introduced an `ActionFilterService` utilizing vector search and BM25 reranking to dynamically filter relevant actions for the LLM, reducing prompt bloat from over 200 to approximately 15 actions ([#6475](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6475)).
- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai**: Implemented persistent, database-backed caching for audio transcriptions and image descriptions to reduce redundant OpenAI API calls and improve latency ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/23)).
- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter**: Added support for `X-Title` and `HTTP-Referer` headers to enhance OpenRouter attribution and ranking, configurable via new environment variables ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23)).

### Web3 Plugin Functionality & Integration
- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm**: Introduced multi-provider RPC abstraction (Alchemy, Infura, Ankr, Eliza Cloud) for automatic fallback and selection, significantly improving reliability and coverage across EVM chains ([#25](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/25)).
- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm**: Overhauled `EVMService` to integrate with Spartan-Intel chain registry, adding wallet/key operations, validation/signing, balance/portfolio management, transfers, DEX registry, and multicall batching ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/24)).
- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana**: Implemented cloud proxy routing for Birdeye and Helius APIs, allowing users without direct API keys to leverage Eliza Cloud, and refactored the transaction system with Token-2022 metadata parsing and exchange-driven swap execution ([#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/26), [#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/24)).
- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana**: Updated README with comprehensive documentation and introduced a new Solana CA lookup provider for on-chain token details ([#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/11), [#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/23)).

### New Plugin Integrations
- **elizaos-plugins/registry**: Expanded the plugin registry with `@proofgate/eliza-plugin` for transaction validation ([#254](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/254), [#257](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/257)), `plugin-coinrailz` for crypto micropayments ([#245](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/245)), and `@kamiyo/eliza` for Solana escrow payments ([#246](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/246)).
- **elizaos-plugins/registry**: Integrated `@zane-archer/plugin-aimo-router` for AiMo Network access ([#247](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/247)), `@elizaos/plugin-sportradar` for live sports data ([#250](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/250)), and AsterPay for x402 payments with EUR off-ramp ([#251](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/251)).
- **elizaos-plugins/registry**: Added `plugin-moltbazaar` for an AI Agent Job Marketplace on Base ([#255](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/255)) and the Arthur DEX plugin for perpetual trading on Orderly Network ([#256](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/256)).

### CLI Stability & Documentation
- **elizaos/eliza**: Fixed critical CLI bugs including ensuring `@elizaos` dependencies use 'latest', validating directory paths to prevent `ENOENT` errors, and enabling agent commands to load `.env` files for authentication ([#6362](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6362), [#6379](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6379), [#6376](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6376)).
