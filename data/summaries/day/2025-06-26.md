Today, the ElizaOS project significantly enhanced model selection flexibility by adding OpenRouter support and refined Ollama embedding. Key improvements were made to the CLI's user experience and plugin management, alongside numerous bug fixes across core infrastructure and client-side UI. Discussions continued on critical issues like character file size limits and user identity management.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5268): The team needs to increase the character file size limit to 100MB and implement a regression test.
    - [elizaos/eliza#105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/105): A decision is needed on whether to transition user tracking from GitHub usernames to internal IDs to resolve "split personality" issues.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
