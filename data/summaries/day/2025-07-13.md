# Overall Project Update (Jul 13, 2025)

## Overview
Today saw significant progress primarily within the `elizaos/eliza` repository, focusing on enhancing Claude AI workflows, resolving critical build and update notification bugs, and advancing CLI testing infrastructure. New development has also commenced on a "Scenario Runner" feature. The `elizaos/auto.fun` and `elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana` repositories had no activity.

## Key Technical Developments

### AI Workflow & Core Enhancements
*   Enabled Claude code review workflow to run on every commit to PRs and granted full bash and GitHub CLI command access to both Claude workflows. [elizaos/eliza#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570)
*   Improved core tests, replaced `execa`, used `bun` runtime, and replaced `local-ai`, emphasizing Ollama. [elizaos/eliza#5556](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5556)
