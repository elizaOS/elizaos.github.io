# Overall Project Update (Jul 14, 2025)

## Overview
Today's primary focus was on enhancing the developer experience and addressing critical bugs within the core `eliza` repository, particularly around build processes and server management. Significant progress was made in ensuring graceful shutdowns and improving the `elizaos start` command. Additionally, the plugin ecosystem expanded with the official inclusion of the Mattermost plugin in the `registry`, while discussions continued on complex issues like custom plugin callback interference and Twitter client initialization errors. No activity was reported in `auto.fun` or `plugin-solana`.

## Key Technical Developments

### Core Development Workflow & Stability
*   Implemented automatic building for the `elizaos start` command, mirroring `dev` functionality [elizaos/eliza#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504).
*   Ensured graceful shutdown of the dev server upon receiving Cmd+C (SIGINT/SIGTERM), preventing orphaned processes [elizaos/eliza#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562).
*   Addressed type safety and testing issues, including comprehensive tests for the `asUUID()` function [elizaos/eliza#5580](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5580).
*   Corrected the usage of the auto-build test flag [elizaos/eliza#5581](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5581).

### Plugin Ecosystem Expansion & Mapping
*   The `plugin-mattermost` has been officially added to the `elizaos-plugins/registry`, expanding client integrations [elizaos-plugins/registry#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188).
*   Mapped the `llama_local` provider in v1 to `@elizaos/plugin-ollama` within the `eliza` core [elizaos/eliza#5582](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5582).
