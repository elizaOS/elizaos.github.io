On July 14, 2025, ElizaOS development focused on enhancing CLI stability and developer experience in the `eliza` repository with critical bug fixes and core type safety improvements, alongside expanding the plugin registry with the addition of the Mattermost plugin. Discussions continued on persistent issues related to custom plugin callback interference and Twitter client initialization errors across multiple repositories.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#4947](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4947) and [elizaos-plugins/registry#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947): The issue where a custom plugin's callback is replaced by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider requires further input to resolve the conflict and implement the proposed fix.
    - [elizaos/eliza#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31) and [elizaos-plugins/registry#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31): The ongoing Twitter Client Initialization Errors need continued investigation and a definitive solution, especially regarding the feasibility of autonomous Twitter agents and potential API limitations.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **CLI Stability and Developer Experience Enhancements**:
    - The `elizaos start` command now automatically builds the project before starting the server, mirroring the `dev` command's behavior, improving the developer workflow ([elizaos/eliza#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504)).
    - Graceful shutdown for the `elizaos dev` server on `Cmd+C` (SIGINT/SIGTERM) was implemented, preventing orphaned processes and resolving a critical server shutdown issue ([elizaos/eliza#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562), [elizaos/eliza#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559)).
    - A related fix addressed the usage of the auto-build test flag, contributing to overall CLI robustness ([elizaos/eliza#5581](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5581)).
- **Core Library Robustness and Integration**:
    - Significant work was done to improve the robustness of the core library by addressing type safety and testing issues, including comprehensive tests for the `asUUID()` function and planning types, and refining error handling ([elizaos/eliza#5580](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5580)).
    - The `llama_local` provider in v1 was mapped to `@elizaos/plugin-ollama`, streamlining provider integration ([elizaos/eliza#5582](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5582)).
- **Plugin Ecosystem Expansion**:
    - The `plugin-mattermost` was added to the registry, expanding the available plugins within the ElizaOS ecosystem ([elizaos-plugins/registry#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)).
