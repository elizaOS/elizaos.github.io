Today's focus was on enhancing the core ElizaOS framework's stability through significant bug fixes, particularly in testing infrastructure and character file imports. Concurrently, user profiles on the website were improved with visual wallet linking, and critical discussions emerged regarding optimizing data fetching processes from the NextJS build to the pipelines workflow.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#130](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/130): Discussion on moving wallet address fetching from NextJS build to Pipelines workflow needs input to ensure proper data handling and caching.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5230](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5230): "API endpoint not found" errors across most server endpoints require immediate investigation to identify the root cause, likely a configuration or initialization problem.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Framework Stability & Testing Improvements
- **Enhanced Test Reliability**: Significant work was done to improve testing infrastructure and reliability across core packages, including re-enabling and fixing server tests, updating test runners, and refining mocking strategies. Unit tests for the SQL plugin were also improved for better reliability and simplified setups.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5231](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5231)
    - [elizaos/eliza#5229](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5229)
- **Bootstrap Plugin Refinements**: Fixes were applied to the bootstrap plugin's tests, along with general code cleanup, to ensure its stability and maintainability.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5227](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5227)
- **Character File Import Resolution**: An issue preventing the import of character JSON files via the UI was resolved by addressing changes in the expected format for `messageExamples` and the removal of certain sections.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5228](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5228)

### User Profile & Documentation Enhancements
- **User Profile Wallet Linking**: A gold checkmark icon is now displayed next to usernames on profile pages for users who have linked their Ethereum or Solana wallets, improving visual recognition of verified linked accounts.
    - [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#124](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/124)
- **Documentation Task Closure**: A documentation task was created and immediately closed, emphasizing that any code fetching data from GitHub or external APIs and storing it in the database should exclusively run within the pipelines.
    - [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#131](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/131)
