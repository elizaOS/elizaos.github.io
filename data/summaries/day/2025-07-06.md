On July 6, 2025, ElizaOS significantly advanced its core `eliza` repository with a major documentation overhaul, introducing a two-track system for users and developers. Key bug fixes addressed API client responses and Windows plugin loading, alongside extensive code quality improvements through linting and CI/CD enhancements. The `plugin-solana` and `auto.fun` repositories had no activity.
