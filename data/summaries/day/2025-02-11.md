Today, ElizaOS focused on core framework enhancements, including dependency updates for Web3 integration, UI refinements, and significant code quality improvements through new tests and bug fixes. Several critical issues emerged concerning environment variable handling and service initialization that require immediate attention.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussion**: [elizaos/eliza#3449](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3449) The `.env` file is not being read, causing the server to run on the default port.
- **Urgent Discussion**: [elizaos/eliza#3448](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3448) The "pnpm start" process is hanging during LlamaService initialization without error messages.
- **Urgent Discussion**: [elizaos/eliza#3441](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3441) Long messages are causing errors with PostgreSQL, indicating a need for better message length handling.
