On October 3, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in dependency management, particularly with the ongoing migration to Zod v4 across multiple plugins, alongside codebase cleanup in `elizaos/eliza`. A key challenge emerged with persistent import errors in Eliza CLI 1.61, which requires further investigation despite some successful local reproductions.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031) and [elizaos/eliza#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031): The "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61" issue persists for `matteo-brandolino` even after clean installs, specifically with `@Elizaos/core` types in new projects, requiring further input to resolve.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Dependency and Version Updates**:
    - The `plugin-autocoder` application version was bumped to 1.3.3, and key dependencies were upgraded for improved stability, including an update to Zod v4. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/pull/1))
- **Codebase Cleanup and Optimization**:
    - Unused `SchemaFactory` code and its associated integration tests were removed from the `plugin-sql` package in `elizaos/eliza`, streamlining the codebase. ([elizaos/eliza#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029))
