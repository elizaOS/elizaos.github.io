On November 14, 2025, the ElizaOS project made substantial progress in core infrastructure, delivering a comprehensive billing system, a robust OAuth/JWT authentication system, and significant chat performance optimizations. Key achievements also include a complete voice infrastructure and the resolution of several cloud and user experience-related issues, while discussions around new plugins and agent debugging are actively ongoing.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#6148](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6148): @wtfsayo is evaluating the "Coin Railz x402 Micropayment Services" plugin submission and needs to provide feedback.
    - [elizaos/eliza#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140): @0xbbjoker has requested more context from @christophwallacher-web regarding LLM plugins to debug a `TEXT_LARGE` delegate type error.

## ✅ Completed Work
- **Core Infrastructure & Cloud Features**:
    - A comprehensive Stripe-backed billing subsystem was implemented, including new database tables, backend routers, a TypeScript API client, and seven new frontend components, addressing [elizaos/eliza#6118](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6118), [elizaos/eliza#6119](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6119), [elizaos/eliza#6120](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6120), and [elizaos/eliza#6123](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6123).
    - A production-ready OAuth and JWT authentication system was integrated, replacing the API-key flow with new types, configurations, services, database migrations, and a new login page, addressing [elizaos/eliza#6126](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6126).
    - The DevTools MCP Server was completed, exploring features like documentation querying, version migration, and deployment assistance [elizaos/eliza#6092](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6092).
    - Analytics for usage metrics of models and services were finalized [elizaos/eliza#6125](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6125).
    - Testing of `plugin-cloud` within the Eliza Framework, including tool registration and documentation accuracy, was completed [elizaos/eliza#6129](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6129).
    - Architectural oversight tasks, including middleware refactors, credit logic, and group routing, were completed [elizaos/eliza#6117](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6117).
- **Performance & Voice Enhancements**:
    - Eliza's chat responsiveness was significantly improved with a new `ModelPerformanceMonitor`, per-model timeouts, exponential-retry wrappers, and integration with fast model providers, addressing [elizaos/eliza#6127](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6127).
    - A complete voice infrastructure was delivered, featuring client-side browser-based TTS, server-side premium voice endpoints, and integration for generating embeddings from voice transcriptions, addressing [elizaos/eliza#6130](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6130).
- **User Experience & Free Tier Enhancements**:
    - Anonymous chat components for non-logged-in users, rate-limited inference endpoints, and chat persistence upon user signup were developed [elizaos/eliza#6115](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6115).
    - Free inference capabilities were integrated with Compute for discounted models, client-side voice testing, and the use of Compute embeddings for free users [elizaos/eliza#6116](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6116).
    - A user's migration issue regarding AI16Z tokens to ELIZAOS tokens was addressed by directing them to open a ticket in the Discord server [elizaos/eliza#6149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6149).
