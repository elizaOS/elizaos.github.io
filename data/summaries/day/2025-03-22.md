On March 22, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused on refining the core framework, with significant progress in user experience through a new drag-and-drop environment upload feature and critical bug fixes for Discord voice functionality. Several new issues emerged, primarily related to import errors, pre-commit hooks, and API key configurations, which will require attention.
