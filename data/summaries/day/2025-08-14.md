Today, ElizaOS focused on enhancing the CLI's publishing capabilities and streamlining release workflows, alongside resolving critical issues related to agent startup and project building. Key achievements include fixing the `elizaos publish` command, addressing agent startup hangs, and resolving project build failures caused by logger formatting.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#5244](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5244): The discussion around deploying custom Eliza agents continues, with the latest comment suggesting exploring AWS as a deployment option. Input is needed to guide deployment strategy.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5770](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5770): A user is experiencing consistent test failures with `bun test` when testing a new plugin; further guidance on debugging mock setup and test isolation is needed.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **CLI & Release Workflow Improvements**:
    - Fixed a critical bug in the `elizaos publish` command affecting `--test` and `--npm` flags, ensuring a more reliable publishing process ([elizaos/eliza#5763](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5763)).
    - Adjusted CI release workflow by removing an automatic 'merge main to develop' step and synchronized metadata across package files, streamlining release procedures ([elizaos/eliza#5775](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5775)).
- **Core Agent & Project Stability**:
    - Resolved a significant issue where the `startAgent` CLI command would hang, particularly related to the `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap`, improving agent startup reliability ([elizaos/eliza#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719)).
    - Fixed Eliza CLI project build failures caused by incorrect `logger.info` formatting in project templates, ensuring successful project creation ([elizaos/eliza#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734)).
- **Scenario Testing Enhancements**:
    - Completed a feature request to add an evaluator for measuring per-step execution duration and asserting against bounds within scenarios, enhancing testing capabilities ([elizaos/eliza#5757](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5757)).
