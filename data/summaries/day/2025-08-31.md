This daily digest highlights significant progress in core stability and plugin expansion, with critical fixes for TypeScript declarations and CLI deployment issues in `elizaos/eliza`. Concurrently, the `elizaos-plugins/registry` saw the addition of a new Vercel AI Gateway plugin, while ongoing discussions address crucial streaming functionality and persistent Discord image generation problems across both repositories.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos-plugins/registry#4720](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4720) and [elizaos/eliza#4720](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4720): Input is needed on the status and official implementation plan for streaming functionality, as users have already implemented unofficial solutions.
    - [elizaos-plugins/registry#5060](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5060) and [elizaos/eliza#5060](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5060): Further discussion is required on integrating streaming API responses, given a user has a working, albeit unofficial, implementation.
    - [elizaos-plugins/registry#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809) and [elizaos/eliza#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809): The Discord image generation issue requires further investigation to determine why images are not appearing despite correct permissions and successful web UI generation.
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#5856](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5856): The new CLI project creation failure due to a "path not found" error needs immediate attention to unblock new project setup.
