Today, ElizaOS saw a significant overhaul of its core build system, migrating packages to a Bun-based architecture for improved efficiency and consistency, alongside enhancements to plugin action handling and template modularity. Concurrently, the plugin registry was refined with alphabetical sorting and integrated new automated code review workflows using Claude Code, while also adding a new "polymarket" plugin. A new feature request was opened for integrating a privacy-focused AI provider.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Build System Modernization & Core Refinements
*   Replaced `tsup` with a new standardized Bun-based build system for ElizaOS packages, improving build efficiency and consistency, and introduced reusable build utilities for `@elizaos/api-client` and `@elizaos/cli`. [elizaos/eliza#5807](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5807)
*   Updated the `GENERATE_IMAGE` handler in `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` to return an `ActionResult`, aligning with the core `Action` contract. [elizaos/eliza#5823](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5823)
*   Moved core multi-step templates into the `@elizaos/core` layer, improving modularity and enabling character-level overrides. [elizaos/eliza#5822](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5822)

### Plugin Registry Enhancements & Automation
*   Improved the plugin registry generation process by adding alphabetical sorting for consistent order of entries. [elizaos-plugins/registry#207](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/207)
*   Added a new "polymarket" plugin to the registry. [elizaos-plugins/registry#205](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/205)
*   Introduced new GitHub Actions workflows to integrate Claude Code for automated code review and comprehensive validation for plugin registry contributions, including NPM package validation. [elizaos-plugins/registry#208](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/208), [elizaos-plugins/registry#206](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/206)
