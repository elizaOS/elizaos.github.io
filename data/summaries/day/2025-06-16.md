Today's development significantly enhanced the ElizaOS framework's stability and test coverage, with critical fixes to CI/autodoc workflows and expanded testing across core components. Concurrently, the `plugin-knowledge` gained a new vector search UI feature, and the `plugin-farcaster` refined its terminology for better ecosystem alignment. Ongoing discussions address callback issues from plugins and the implementation of service types.
