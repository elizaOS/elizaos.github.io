On October 27, 2025, ElizaOS significantly advanced its core infrastructure by unifying messaging APIs and introducing a Jobs API for one-off agent communication, alongside implementing a new CLI command for cloud authentication. Concurrently, the project enhanced its community engagement and performance with adaptive rate limiting for GitHub API operations and the launch of an MVP badge system for contributor recognition. These updates collectively streamline development, improve system efficiency, and foster a more interactive community environment.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Infrastructure & Agent Communication Enhancements
- **Unified Messaging API**: Implemented a unified `elizaOS.sendMessage()` API to streamline communication across ElizaOS clients, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability. ([elizaos/eliza#6095](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6095), [elizaos/eliza#6098](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6098))
- **Jobs API for One-Off Messaging**: Introduced a Jobs API enabling external systems to send single messages and poll for responses without persistent sessions, ideal for stateless integrations. ([elizaos/eliza#6098](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6098))
- **CLI Cloud Authentication**: Added a new `elizaos login` CLI command to provide CLI-side integration for ElizaOS Cloud services. ([elizaos/eliza#6100](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6100))

### Performance & Community Engagement Improvements
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting for GitHub API**: Implemented adaptive rate limiting with low-volume optimization to significantly improve GitHub API operations for high-volume repositories while maintaining zero overhead for typical workloads. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#160](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/160))
- **MVP Contributor Badge System**: Introduced a minimal and efficient badge/achievement system with 5 badge types across 3 tier levels (beginner/elite/legend) to recognize contributor achievements, designed with DRY and YAGNI principles. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/161))
