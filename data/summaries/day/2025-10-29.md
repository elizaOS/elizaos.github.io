On October 29, 2025, ElizaOS significantly advanced its core infrastructure by introducing PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for multi-tenancy and enhancing server stability with new health check endpoints. Concurrently, the OpenAI plugin underwent a major architectural refactoring for improved modularity and a critical tokenization bug fix, while documentation was updated to boost community engagement.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core System Enhancements & Stability
*   Multi-tenancy capabilities were significantly bolstered in the ElizaOS server with the introduction of PostgreSQL Row-Level Security, allowing secure sharing of a single database among multiple independent ElizaOS servers. ([elizaos/eliza#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101))
*   Server stability was improved by adding public health check endpoints, resolving issues where load balancers failed due to authentication requirements. ([elizaos/eliza#6103](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6103))

### Plugin Modularity & Bug Fixes
*   The `plugin-openai` repository saw a major architectural refactoring, transforming a monolithic 1,253-line file into a modular structure, aligning it with the `plugin-openrouter` pattern for better organization and maintainability. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/19))
*   A critical TypeScript type error in the `plugin-openai` tokenization utility was resolved, ensuring correct tokenization fallback and bumping the version to 1.5.18. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/20))

### Client-Side Improvements & Documentation
*   A critical bug preventing the creation of DM channels in the GUI client was fixed by ensuring the correct server ID is used. ([elizaos/eliza#6105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6105))
*   The core `Action` component was enhanced to support arbitrary custom options via an index signature, increasing flexibility for developers. ([elizaos/eliza#6104](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6104))
*   A more prominent call-to-action for joining the Discord community was added to the top right of the documentation, improving visibility and accessibility. ([elizaos/docs#78](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/78))

## üêû Issue Triage
### Closed Issues
*   **elizaos/eliza**: An issue related to adding social media buttons to the navigation was closed, which involved adding a Discord button to the top header and a Farcaster button to the bottom footer. ([elizaos/eliza#6089](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6089))
