Today, ElizaOS significantly enhanced its core server with multi-tenancy via PostgreSQL RLS and improved health checks, while the OpenAI plugin underwent a major architectural refactoring for modularity and fixed a critical tokenization bug. Documentation also improved community engagement with a more prominent Discord call-to-action.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Core Server Enhancements & Stability
*   Multi-tenancy was bolstered in the ElizaOS server with the introduction of PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) for secure database sharing among independent servers ([elizaos/eliza#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101)).
*   Public health check endpoints were added to the server, resolving issues with load balancer health checks in production deployments ([elizaos/eliza#6103](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6103)).

### Plugin Modularity & Bug Fixes
*   The OpenAI plugin was refactored from a single large file into a modular architecture, enhancing maintainability and scalability ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/19)).
*   A TypeScript type error in the tokenization utility was resolved, ensuring correct tokenization fallback and including a version bump to 1.5.18 ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/20)).

### Client-Side Improvements & Documentation
*   A critical bug preventing the creation of DM channels in the GUI client was resolved by using the actual server ID ([elizaos/eliza#6105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6105)).
*   Custom options can now be added to `Action` via an index signature, providing more flexibility for developers ([elizaos/eliza#6104](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6104)).
*   A more prominent call-to-action for joining the Discord community was added to the top right of the documentation site, improving visibility and accessibility for new users ([elizaos/docs#78](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/78)).

## üêû Issue Triage
### Closed Issues
*   **elizaos/eliza**: An issue related to updating the website's navigation was closed, which involved adding a Discord button to the top header and a Farcaster button to the bottom footer ([elizaos/eliza#6089](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6089)).
