Overall Project Summary:
Today's focus across ElizaOS involved significant enhancements to core testing infrastructure and API capabilities within `elizaos/eliza`, including E2E test coverage for all starter templates and integration of the new Sessions API. Concurrently, efforts began to debug a critical `pdfjs-dist` crashing issue in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge`, which also prompted a request for more user information to aid reproduction. A new issue regarding outdated documentation and the ElizaOS blog was also raised.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/37) and [elizaos/eliza#37](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/37): User `0xbbjoker` requires more information (setup details, loading methods, specific PDFs) from the issue creator to reproduce a critical `pdfjs-dist` crashing error.
    - [elizaos/eliza#5722](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5722): Discussion needed regarding the outdated `CHANGELOG.md` and the status of the ElizaOS blog.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Enhanced Testing Infrastructure**:
    - Enabled End-to-End (E2E) testing for all starter templates, addressing previous inconsistencies and allowing for more robust integration validation: [elizaos/eliza#5720](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5720).
- **API Client Expansion and Core Cleanup**:
    - Updated the API client to include support for the new Sessions API, providing a simplified interface for managing conversational state: [elizaos/eliza#5717](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5717).
    - Removed unused plugin specification systems from the core package, streamlining the codebase: [elizaos/eliza#5724](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5724).
- **Database Support Improvements**:
    - Implemented a fix to ensure proper support for `plugin-mysql`, allowing its use before `plugin-sql` is enforced: [elizaos/eliza#5718](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5718).
