On Feb 12, 2025, ElizaOS development focused on enhancing the CLI utility with new plugin management features and addressing critical bugs, particularly in client speech-to-text functionality. While significant progress was made in resolving issues like the `supressInitialMessage` property and LlamaService initialization hangs, new challenges emerged with client startup errors related to sqlite-vec extensions and a re-occurrence of the `supressInitialMessage` issue.
