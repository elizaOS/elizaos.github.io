# Overall Project Update (Jul 10, 2025)

## Overview
Today saw significant progress in the core ElizaOS platform with enhancements to Claude code review, action chaining, and various bug fixes. Plugin development focused on refactoring `plugin-knowledge` for improved type safety and dependency updates, while the plugin registry saw a new entry. Discussions continued on critical plugin loading and compatibility issues across several repositories, highlighting ongoing challenges with `plugin-local-ai` and the Twitter client.
