Overall Project Summary for Nov 10, 2025

Today, significant progress was made in enhancing PDF text extraction efficiency across the ElizaOS ecosystem with the migration to `unpdf`, alongside critical bug fixes addressing environment variable loading and RLS validation. Discussions continued on the "My Agents" dashboard redesign, and a new feature for granular control over text generation was introduced.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussion**: `elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter` and `elizaos/eliza` issue [#6119](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6119) (Dashboard Redesign Discussion) needs input to move forward, with Rassakia expressing interest in contributing.
- **Blocked Issue**: `elizaos/eliza` issue [#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140) (Agent Communication Errors) reports an `Error [E.v.A] MessageBusService: Error processing message`, causing agents to not respond, requiring immediate investigation.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core System Enhancements
- **Improved PDF Text Extraction**: The `plugin-knowledge` repository migrated from `pdfjs-dist` to `unpdf` for universal PDF text extraction, significantly reducing dependency size and enabling broader environment support ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#46](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/46)).

### Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements
- **RLS Validation Fix**: A bug where Row-Level Security (RLS) `server_id` validation checks were blocking users when RLS isolation was disabled was fixed in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6139)).
- **Race Condition Prevention**: A message emit in the `src` API was removed to prevent race conditions in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6137](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6137)).
