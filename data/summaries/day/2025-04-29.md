On Apr 29, 2025, ElizaOS development focused on enhancing core framework capabilities, including improved logging, searchable knowledge scoping, and automated monorepo package building. Significant progress was made in bug resolution, particularly for agent deletion and local AI errors, alongside UI refinements and codebase streamlining.
