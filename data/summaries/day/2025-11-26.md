On Nov 26, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw a significant push towards standardizing structured logging across several plugin repositories, including `plugin-knowledge`, `plugin-telegram`, `plugin-openrouter`, and `plugin-discord`. Concurrently, the core `eliza` repository addressed a critical TypeScript declaration bug and opened numerous new issues focusing on UI/UX improvements, agent builder optimizations, and payment system enhancements. This indicates a dual focus on foundational code quality and strategic feature development.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core System Stability
*   A critical TypeScript declaration build failure related to `instanceof` checks was resolved in `elizaos/eliza` by introducing an `isPlainObject` type guard, enhancing core codebase robustness. ([elizaos/eliza#6170](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6170))

### Codebase Refinements
*   Dead/commented code was removed and clarifying comments were added in the Discord service within `elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord` to improve maintainability. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#28](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/28))
