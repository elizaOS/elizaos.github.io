On October 30, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant development in agent functionality with the enhancement of RAG document management in `plugin-knowledge` and new wallet features in `plugin-solana`. A critical bug fix for agent settings persistence was initiated in `eliza`, while a widespread issue concerning incorrect weekly summary dates on user profiles was reported across multiple repositories and is currently under investigation.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussion**: The widespread "Incorrect Weekly Summary Dates" issue [#168](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/168) has been reported across multiple repositories and requires investigation to resolve the display error on user profiles and leaderboards.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Agent Capability Enhancements
- **Enhanced RAG Document Management**: A new static provider was implemented in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge` to list available RAG documents with metadata, improving context efficiency for agents ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#45](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/45)).
