On Sep 25, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused heavily on core refactoring within the `elizaos/eliza` repository, addressing critical issues related to Zod v4 migration and improving runtime initialization. Key achievements include the completion of the Eliza CLI refactoring and the resolution of a Zod v4 loading problem, while new pull requests aim to enhance service registration and idempotency.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Core System Stability & Refactoring**
    - The extensive refactoring of the Eliza CLI, simplifying its structure and delegating logic to project directories, has been completed ([elizaos/eliza#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)).
    - A critical issue where Zod v4 was not loading in version 1.5.10, causing plugin failures, has been resolved by manually adding `zod` ([elizaos/eliza#5995](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5995)).
