On Sep 25, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused heavily on core runtime improvements and addressing critical dependency issues, with significant refactoring efforts underway to enhance service registration and resolve Zod v4 migration challenges. The day saw the closure of a major CLI refactoring initiative and a fix for a Zod v4 loading problem, while new issues highlighted unhandled exceptions and the ongoing need for Zod v4 migration across the monorepo.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Core System Refactoring & Dependency Management
- The extensive refactoring of the Eliza CLI, simplifying its structure and delegating logic to project directories, has been completed, shifting towards projects owning their runtime and the CLI acting as a delegator. [elizaos/eliza#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)
- A critical issue where Zod v4 was not loading in version 1.5.10, causing several plugins to fail, has been resolved by manually adding `zod` and fixing the `plugin-openrouter`. [elizaos/eliza#5995](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5995)
