On Feb 8, 2025, the ElizaOS team focused on refining core functionalities, including significant refactoring to adopt a handler pattern for improved modularity and fixing several critical bugs related to CLI commands and character loading. New issues emerged concerning plugin usability, Docker startup problems, and Twitter agent functionality, highlighting areas for immediate attention.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#3385](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3385): Agents getting stuck on startup in Docker environments for v0.25.6-alpha.1 needs immediate investigation.
    - [elizaos/eliza#3380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3380): Users are unable to use `plugin-evm` after installation, indicating potential configuration issues.
    - [elizaos/eliza#3387](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3387): Clarification is needed for quick start instructions due to the `eliza-starter` being a separate repository.
