Today, the project saw significant advancements in both core framework architecture and plugin capabilities. The `elizaos/eliza` repository focused on streamlining the CLI by integrating server/core functionalities and refining plugin error handling, while `elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana` made critical progress on Token-2022 support and bug fixes, enhancing wallet data management and application resilience. These efforts collectively improve the framework's stability, modularity, and ability to interact with advanced blockchain features.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Core CLI Simplification and Architectural Alignment
- The CLI has been significantly simplified by removing redundant module loaders and integrating server/core functionalities directly, reducing duplication and improving overall architecture. [elizaos/eliza#6060](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6060)
- Server code was refactored to utilize ElizaOS global functions, and bootstrap logic was decoupled from the CLI, centralizing it within the core for a cleaner architecture. [elizaos/eliza#5933](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5933)

### Enhanced Plugin Error Handling
- Plugin error handling was improved to correctly use the `ZodError.issues` API, ensuring consistent and proper error reporting across different plugin starters. [elizaos/eliza#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035)

### Solana Plugin Token-2022 Support and Wallet Data
- The Solana plugin now includes Token-2022-aware token parsing, supporting symbols, mutability, and supply, along with batch symbol backfill and combined SPL+Token-2022 account discovery. [elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/14)

### Solana Plugin Bug Fixes and Resilience
- Critical TypeScript errors were resolved, logging was improved, and the application now continues in standalone mode if trading services are unavailable, enhancing stability. [elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/15)
