On October 16, 2025, the ElizaOS project significantly advanced its core architecture by streamlining the CLI and enhancing plugin error handling in `elizaos/eliza`, while simultaneously bolstering Web3 capabilities with critical bug fixes and upgraded Token-2022 support in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana`. These efforts collectively improve stability, reduce code duplication, and expand functionality across the framework.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Core CLI Simplification and Architectural Alignment
- The CLI in `elizaos/eliza` was simplified to directly use server/core functionalities, eliminating a custom module-loader and reducing code duplication ([elizaos/eliza#6060](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6060)).
- A major refactoring in `elizaos/eliza` aligned server code with ElizaOS global functions and decoupled bootstrap logic from the CLI, removing custom logic and cleaning up modular loaders ([elizaos/eliza#5933](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5933)).

### Enhanced Plugin Error Handling
- Error handling for plugins in `elizaos/eliza` was improved by correcting ZodError API usage from `.errors` to `.issues` and implementing robust handling for non-ZodError cases in starter plugins ([elizaos/eliza#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035)).

### Solana Plugin Stability and Token-2022 Support
- `elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana` received significant upgrades for Token-2022 support, including token-aware parsing, batch symbol backfill, combined SPL+Token-2022 account discovery, and live wallet data updates ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/14)).
- Bug fixes in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana` resolved TypeScript errors, improved logging, and added startup retry with clearer progress for enhanced application stability ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/15)).
