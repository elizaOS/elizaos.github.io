Today, the ElizaOS project significantly enhanced its core `eliza` repository by introducing automatic plugin installation and refining runtime initialization for better stability and environment variable handling. This work aims to make the agent framework more robust and user-friendly, particularly in managing external plugins and ensuring correct configuration.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#15](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/15): The "Eliza agent is not aware by plugin evm" issue continues to be a challenge for users, with ongoing discussion about correct plugin configuration and environment variable handling, specifically `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`. Input is needed to clarify the setup process and resolve user difficulties.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Core Runtime Stability & Configuration**:
    - Improved runtime initialization to ensure correct settings at creation, resolving a race condition affecting adapter environment variables like the Postgres URL. [elizaos/eliza#6008](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6008)
    - Refined environment variable loading for monorepo awareness and improved logic for activating Ollama as a fallback LLM provider only when no others are configured. [elizaos/eliza#6005](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6005)
- **Enhanced Plugin Management**:
    - Added a new feature to the server's `PluginLoader` for automatic installation of missing plugins on demand, preventing runtime failures and improving ease of use. [elizaos/eliza#6006](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6006)
