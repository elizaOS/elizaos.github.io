Today, ElizaOS focused on enhancing plugin management with new auto-installation capabilities and critical refinements to runtime initialization for improved stability and environment variable handling. Discussions are ongoing regarding the Eliza agent's awareness of the `plugin-evm`, with troubleshooting steps being actively explored.

## üö® Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#15](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/15): The Eliza agent is still not recognizing the `plugin-evm`, requiring further investigation into plugin naming, versioning, and environment variable configuration.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
- **Core Runtime Stability and Configuration**:
    - Improved runtime initialization to ensure correct settings at creation, resolving a race condition with environment variables like Postgres URL ([elizaos/eliza#6008](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6008)).
    - Refined environment variable loading for monorepo awareness and improved Ollama fallback logic ([elizaos/eliza#6005](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6005)).
- **Enhanced Plugin Management**:
    - Implemented automatic installation of missing plugins in the server's PluginLoader to prevent runtime failures and streamline development ([elizaos/eliza#6006](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6006)).
