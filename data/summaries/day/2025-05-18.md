On May 18, 2025, ElizaOS made significant strides in framework enhancement, particularly with the integration of the Polygon plugin and its gas oracle, alongside crucial API improvements like world selection and agent ID returns. Documentation and workflow fixes also contributed to overall stability, though a new npm dependency conflict emerged requiring attention.

## üö® Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**: A new issue in `elizaos/eliza` regarding peer dependency conflicts with the `zod` library is affecting builds in other repositories and needs to be published to npm to resolve ([elizaos/eliza#4562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4562)).

## ‚úÖ Completed Work
### Plugin & Blockchain Integration
- Implemented the Polygon Gas Oracle Integration, crucial for gas estimation in transactions within the ElizaOS framework ([elizaos/eliza#4574](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4574)).
- Added the core Polygon Plugin, including EVM RPC wrappers and basic read operations, expanding ElizaOS's Web3 capabilities ([elizaos/eliza#4635](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4635)).
- Finalized the Polygon plugin integration by merging the `addpolygon` resolution ([elizaos/eliza#4636](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4636)).

### API & Core Framework Enhancements
- Added a missing plugin failure test to improve robustness during plugin installation ([elizaos/eliza#4643](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4643)).
- Introduced an optional `worldId` query parameter for the message API, enabling better memory tracking for agents ([elizaos/eliza#4637](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4637)).
- Enhanced the API to return the ID of newly created agents, streamlining subsequent API calls and agent management ([elizaos/eliza#4634](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4634)).

### Documentation & Workflow Improvements
- Comprehensively updated project documentation, including blog posts and partner documentation, to provide clearer guidance ([elizaos/eliza#4586](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4586)).
- Fixed the documentation deployment workflow to ensure proper npm caching and streamline deployment processes ([elizaos/eliza#4640](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4640)).
- Enhanced the ElizaOS CLI command for better character file handling and consistent behavior, improving developer experience ([elizaos/eliza#4618](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4618)).
