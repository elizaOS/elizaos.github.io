On Sep 30, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in UI/UX with enhanced Agent Run visualizations, critical stability improvements for CLI commands and TypeScript configurations, and a major refactoring of dynamic SQL migration processes. Strategic planning for cloud wireframes and agent SWOT analysis also commenced, alongside new ideas for novel agent applications.
