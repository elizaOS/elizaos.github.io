Today, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in core framework stability and plugin development, with critical TypeScript declaration and export issues resolved in `elizaos/eliza` for `plugin-sql`, and table creation re-enabled in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql`. Additionally, `elizaos/spartan` underwent a major API route reorganization, introducing new features like payment protection and analytics endpoints.

## 🚨 Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#37](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/37): The ongoing discussion about ElizaOS functionality concerns, specifically the "initial burst post of 2-5 posts then stops" issue, needs further investigation despite a user reporting a temporary workaround.
    - [elizaos/spartan#37](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/37): The "Spartan News Service Functionality" issue, where the service stops after a few posts, requires attention to ensure a stable resolution beyond the current workaround.
    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/37): The "Plugin Functionality Concerns" for `plugin-mysql` needs to be addressed to ensure the plugin's long-term stability, as a user reported it's "working, at least for now...".

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Framework Stability & Plugin Enhancements
- **TypeScript Declaration and Export Fixes**:
    - Corrected `types` path in `package.json` exports and removed non-existent directory from `files` array, resolving TypeScript import errors for `@elizaos/plugin-sql`. ([elizaos/eliza#6134](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6134))
    - Addressed TypeScript declaration generation errors by implementing the missing `hasElizaOS()` method in `test-utils` mock runtime and fixing `plugin-sql`'s declaration generation. ([elizaos/eliza#6146](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6146))
- **Database Migration Re-enabled**:
    - Re-enabled table creation (migrations) functionality within `plugin-mysql`, specifically impacting the `src/mysql2/manager.ts` file, which is crucial for database schema management. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql#2](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/pull/2))

### API Architecture & Feature Development
- **API Route Reorganization and New Features**:
    - Completed a major reorganization of routes within the `degenIntel` plugin, including the addition of a payment protection layer across API routes and new analytics endpoints for market data, indicating a substantial restructuring of the API architecture. ([elizaos/spartan#23](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/23))
