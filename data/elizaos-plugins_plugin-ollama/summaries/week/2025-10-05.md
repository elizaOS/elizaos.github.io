# elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on improving project stability and dependency management. A significant community-driven investigation successfully diagnosed a critical import error affecting users of `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1, tracing the root cause to malformed type definition files in the upstream package. This collaborative debugging effort underscored the importance of robust build and publish pipelines. Concurrently, work began to automate dependency maintenance with the introduction of a Renovate configuration, aiming to proactively manage updates and enhance long-term stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
- **Dependency Management Automation**: To streamline maintenance and ensure dependencies remain current, a pull request ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/pull/16)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration file. This will help automate the process of creating pull requests for dependency updates.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week according to the provided reports.

- **New & Active Issues:** The primary focus was on a single critical issue:
    - **Investigation into `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1 Import Errors ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/issues/6031))**: A major discussion unfolded around imports failing for users on `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1. The investigation, driven by detailed analysis from user `matteo-brandolino`, confirmed that the issue was not related to user configuration but stemmed from the package itself. A final diagnosis concluded that v1.6.1 was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files, making key exports like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` unavailable. The recommended resolution is for users to upgrade to a version newer than 1.6.1.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong community collaboration in troubleshooting. The resolution of issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/issues/6031) was a prime example of effective partnership between users and maintainers. User `matteo-brandolino` provided exceptionally detailed diagnostic information, including system details and `tsc` error logs, which was instrumental in pinpointing the problem. This enabled a swift and definitive conclusion that the fault lay within the upstream `@elizaos/core` package, demonstrating the value of detailed community feedback in maintaining the health of the ecosystem.
