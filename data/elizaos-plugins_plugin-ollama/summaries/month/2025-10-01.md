# elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama Monthly Report (October 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
October's efforts were centered on foundational stability and collaborative troubleshooting. While no new features were merged into the plugin itself, significant progress was made in diagnosing a critical upstream dependency issue. Community collaboration was instrumental in pinpointing a bug in `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1 that caused widespread import errors. Additionally, proactive steps were taken to improve long-term project health by introducing automated dependency management.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Development work this month focused on improving the project's maintenance infrastructure rather than adding new features.

- **Dependency Management Automation**: To streamline maintenance and ensure the plugin stays up-to-date with its dependencies, a pull request was opened to add a Renovate configuration ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/pull/16)). This aims to automate the process of updating dependencies, reducing manual effort and potential integration issues.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue triage was the primary activity this month, with a focus on a single, high-impact bug affecting users of a specific Eliza CLI version.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.

- **New & Active Issues:** The main focus was on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/issues/6031), "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61". Extensive investigation by the community revealed that this is likely not a bug within `plugin-ollama` but rather in the upstream `@elizaos/core` package. Detailed analysis, including `tsc --noEmit` outputs showing 28 errors, strongly suggests that incorrect type definition files were published in `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1. This issue represents a significant blocker for users on that specific core version, though workarounds like downgrading or upgrading the core package are effective.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This month highlighted a healthy and engaged community focused on collaborative problem-solving. The discussion around issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/issues/6031) showcased a strong partnership between users and maintainers. User `matteo-brandolino` provided exceptionally detailed analysis, error logs, and environment confirmations, which were crucial in diagnosing the problem. This interaction demonstrates the project's ability to effectively leverage community expertise to troubleshoot complex issues, even those originating in upstream dependencies.
