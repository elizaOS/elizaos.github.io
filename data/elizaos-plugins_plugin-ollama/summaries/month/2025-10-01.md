# elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development focused on foundational maintenance and critical bug investigation. A key initiative was the introduction of automated dependency management through a new Renovate configuration. Concurrently, significant effort was dedicated to diagnosing a compatibility issue with a specific version of the Eliza CLI, with community collaboration successfully narrowing down the root cause to a potential type definition problem in an upstream package.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving project maintenance and stability.

- **Dependency Management Automation**
  - To ensure the plugin stays current with its dependencies, a pull request ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/pull/16)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration file to the repository. This aims to automate the process of updating dependencies, reducing manual overhead and preventing stale packages.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was focused on a single, high-impact active issue. No new issues were opened and no issues were closed during this reporting period.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - The primary focus was on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/issues/6031), which addresses import errors experienced in IDEs when using Eliza CLI version 1.6.1.
  - Investigation by `@matteo-brandolino` suggested the problem likely originates from malformed type definition files (`.d.ts`) within the `@Elizaos/core` package, which reference source files not included in the published NPM package.
  - It was confirmed that the issue is specific to version 1.6.1, as downgrading to 1.5.15 or upgrading to a newer version resolves the IDE errors. This represents a significant step toward isolating the bug for a fix in the core framework.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the focused debugging efforts on active issues. The discussion on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/issues/6031) showcased effective teamwork between contributors `@matteo-brandolino` and `@0xbbjoker`. Their combined efforts in testing, reporting detailed findings, and analyzing potential root causes were instrumental in pinpointing the problem's origin within the `@Elizaos/core` dependency.
