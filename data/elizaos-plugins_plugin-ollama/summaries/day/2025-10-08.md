### Investigation into `@elizaos/core` Import Errors [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/issues/6031)
Discussion continued on the issue where imports like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` are not found in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.6.1. @matteo-brandolino clarified their OS as Arch Linux. Earlier, @claude provided a comprehensive diagnosis, identifying the root cause as missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, stemming from a build/publish pipeline issue. Recommendations include upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later and considering deprecation of v1.6.1. @0xbbjoker had previously attempted to reproduce the issue without success and requested system details from @matteo-brandolino.
