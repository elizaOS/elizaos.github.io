### Troubleshooting Import Errors in Eliza CLI 1.61 [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/issues/6031)
Discussion continued regarding the "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61" issue. @matteo-brandolino provided an update, confirming that the issue persists on Arch Linux and shared the output of `bun x tsc --noEmit`, which showed 28 errors across 4 files, primarily related to missing exports from `@elizaos/core`. These included `logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, `Project`, `ProjectAgent`, `Character`, `UUID`, and various types related to plugins. This detailed output further supports the hypothesis that the problem lies within the `@elizaos/core` package itself, specifically version 1.6.1.
