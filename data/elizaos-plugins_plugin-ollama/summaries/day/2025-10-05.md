### Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61
Discussion continued on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/issues/6031), concerning "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61". The latest comment from matteo-brandolino suggests that the problem might stem from incorrect type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically `dist/index.d.ts` and `dist/types/index.d.ts` referencing non-existent source files. It was noted that downgrading to `@Elizaos/core` version 1.5.15 resolves the issue, and versions newer than 1.6.1 also appear to work correctly, indicating a potential bug specific to version 1.6.1.
