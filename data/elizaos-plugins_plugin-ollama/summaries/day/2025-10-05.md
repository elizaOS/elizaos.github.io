## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61**: User matteo-brandolino provided a detailed analysis, suggesting the issue might stem from type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically `dist/index.d.ts` and `dist/types/index.d.ts`, referencing source files not present in the published package. They noted that downgrading to version 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem, implying a bug specific to version 1.6.1. Previously, 0xbbjoker had requested matteo-brandolino to run `bun x tsc --noEmit` to further diagnose the issue, suspecting a problem with the IDE's TSC compiler. matteo-brandolino confirmed the issue persists with `bun x tsc --noEmit`, providing a comprehensive list of 28 errors across 4 files, reinforcing the belief that the problem lies within the `@elizaos/core` package's type definitions.
