      "body": "Free Tier only allows 1 endpoint interaction / 15 mins\nBasic Tier costs $200/month (really pricey for a basic twitter bot)\nQuestion: can we avoid fetching the home timeline at startup? I used 67 of 100 monthly allocated posts with that initial fetch.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create new Project on X developer portal using readme instructions\n2. i started with a fairly basic configuration\n\n> `# Basic Configuration\n> TWITTER_DRY_RUN=true              # Set to true to test without posting\n> TWITTER_ENABLE_POST=true           # Enable autonomous tweet posting\n> TWITTER_ENABLE_REPLIES=true        # Enable mention and reply handling\n> TWITTER_ENABLE_ACTIONS=false       # Enable timeline actions (likes, retweets, quotes)\n> TWITTER_ENABLE_DISCOVERY=false\n> \n> # Optional: Posting Configuration\n> TWITTER_POST_IMMEDIATELY=true      # Post on startup (great for testing)\n> TWITTER_POST_INTERVAL=120          # Minutes between posts (default: 120)\n> # For more natural timing, use MIN/MAX intervals:\n> TWITTER_POST_INTERVAL_MIN=90       # Minimum minutes between posts  \n> TWITTER_POST_INTERVAL_MAX=150      # Maximum minutes between posts`\n\n3. Ran elizaos dev to startup the project. An agent i created has the twitter plugin added.\n4. Got a 429 rate limiting error right away and web client\n\n> `Startup successful!\n> Go to the dashboard at http://localhost:3000\n> AgentServer is listening on port 3000\n> [2025-08-15 13:53:45] INFO: Final plugins being loaded:\n>     plugins: [\n>       \"@elizaos/plugin-sql\",\n>       \"openai\",\n>       \"twitter\",\n>       \"bootstrap\"\n>     ]\n> [2025-08-15 13:53:45] INFO: Initializing character\n> [2025-08-15 13:53:45] INFO: Name:  Eliza\n> [2025-08-15 13:53:45] INFO: plugin-sql init starting...\n> [2025-08-15 13:53:45] INFO: Database adapter created and registered\n> [2025-08-15 13:53:46] INFO: Twitter posting is DISABLED - set TWITTER_ENABLE_POST=true to enable automatic posting\n> [2025-08-15 13:53:46] INFO: Twitter replies/interactions are ENABLED\n> [2025-08-15 13:53:46] INFO: Twitter timeline actions are DISABLED\n> [2025-08-15 13:53:46] INFO: Twitter discovery service is DISABLED - set TWITTER_ENABLE_DISCOVERY=true to enable\n> [2025-08-15 09:53:45.765 -0400] INFO: Running plugin migrations...\n>     agentName: \"Eliza\"\n>     logLevel: \"info\"\n> [2025-08-15 09:53:45.765 -0400] INFO: Found 1 plugins with schemas to migrate.\n>     agentName: \"Eliza\"\n>     logLevel: \"info\"\n> [2025-08-15 09:53:45.765 -0400] INFO: Running migrations for plugin: @elizaos/plugin-sql\n>     agentName: \"Eliza\"\n>     logLevel: \"info\"\n> [2025-08-15 09:53:45.765 -0400] INFO: Successfully migrated plugin: @elizaos/plugin-sql\n>     agentName: \"Eliza\"\n>     logLevel: \"info\"\n> [2025-08-15 09:53:45.765 -0400] INFO: Plugin migrations completed.\n>     agentName: \"Eliza\"\n>     logLevel: \"info\"\n> [2025-08-15 13:53:46] INFO: Successfully authenticated with Twitter API v2\n> [2025-08-15 13:54:01] INFO: Twitter interaction client will check in 30.0 minutes\n> [2025-08-15 13:54:01] INFO: [Eliza] MessageBusService: Subscribing to internal message bus for 'new_message', 'message_deleted', and 'channel_cleared' events.\n> [2025-08-15 13:54:01] WARN: DatabaseMigrationService not found - plugin schema migrations skipped\n> [2025-08-15 13:54:01] INFO: [Eliza] MessageBusService: Agent is subscribed to 1 servers (including default server)\n> [2025-08-15 13:54:01] INFO: [Eliza] MessageBusService: Fetched 10 channels from server 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\n> [2025-08-15 13:54:01] INFO: [Eliza] MessageBusService: Loaded 10 valid channel IDs from 1 servers (including default server)\n> [2025-08-15 13:54:01] INFO: [AgentServer] Automatically registered MessageBusConnector for agent Eliza\n> [2025-08-15 13:54:01] INFO: [AgentServer] Auto-associated agent Eliza with server ID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\n> Search error:  99 |             }\n> 100 |             else {\n> 101 |                 errorString += ' - ' + this.formatV2Error(data);\n> 102 |             }\n> 103 |         }\n> 104 |         return new types_1.ApiResponseError(errorString, {\n>                      ^\n> error: Request failed with code 429\n>      error: true,\n>       type: \"response\",\n>       code: 429,\n>    headers: {\n>   date: \"Fri, 15 Aug 2025 13:54:01 GMT\",\n>   \"content-type\": \"application/json;
