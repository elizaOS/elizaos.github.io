      "body": "This PR ensures the Twitter plugin follows the established pattern for message processing used consistently across all ElizaOS platform plugins.\r\n\r\n### Current Implementation Status\r\n\r\nThe Twitter plugin correctly uses the standard messageService API pattern:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst result = await this.runtime.messageService!.handleMessage(\r\n  this.runtime, message, callback\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\n- `messageService` is a **public property** of the `IAgentRuntime` interface (defined in `packages/core/src/types/runtime.ts:26`)\r\n- This is the **standard API** used consistently across all platform plugins:\r\n  - **Discord**: Uses `runtime.messageService.handleMessage()`\r\n  - **Telegram**: Uses `runtime.messageService!.handleMessage()`\r\n  - **Twitter**: Uses `runtime.messageService!.handleMessage()`\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- ✅ Verified Twitter plugin uses the correct public API\r\n- ✅ Consistent with Discord and Telegram implementations  \r\n- ✅ Updated `@elizaos/core` dependency to `workspace:*` for local development\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\n- **Consistency**: Follows the same pattern as all other platform plugins\r\n- **Maintainability**: Uses the established public `IMessageService` interface\r\n- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript typing through the public interface\r\n\r\n",
