      "title": "fix: resolve auth retry loop, implement media upload, and fix mention…",
      "author": "2-A-M",
      "number": 48,
      "body": "… replies\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses multiple critical bugs discovered during comprehensive testing:\r\n\r\n**1. Fix infinite auth retry loop (src/base.ts)**\r\n- Added error throwing when authentication succeeds but verification fails\r\n- Prevents infinite loop when credentials are valid but verification returns false\r\n- Preserves existing exponential backoff and 3-retry limit\r\n\r\n**2. Implement media upload support (5 files)**\r\n- src/post.ts: Added media upload via v1.uploadMedia() before posting\r\n- src/services/PostService.ts: Added same media upload logic for service layer\r\n- src/utils.ts: Added mediaIds parameter to sendTweet()\r\n- src/client/client.ts: Added mediaIds parameter to sendTweet()\r\n- src/client/tweets.ts: Updated createCreateTweetRequest() to use media_ids\r\n- Uses Twitter API v1 for media upload (v2 doesn't support it)\r\n- Successfully tested with images and videos\r\n\r\n**3. Fix mention reply functionality (src/interactions.ts)**\r\n- Added check for messageService availability before calling it\r\n- Prevents crash when messageService is undefined\r\n- Implemented TWITTER_AUTO_RESPOND_MENTIONS setting check\r\n- Implemented TWITTER_AUTO_RESPOND_REPLIES setting check\r\n- Added logic to distinguish between mentions and replies\r\n- Added logging when tweets are skipped due to settings\r\n\r\nAll fixes have been tested and build successfully.\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **New Features**\n  * Tweets can attach uploaded media via stable media IDs.\n  * New AUTO_RESPOND settings to enable/disable auto-replies to mentions and replies.\n\n* **Bug Fixes**\n  * Stricter authentication verification during startup to surface failed verifications.\n  * Added safety checks to skip processing when required services are unavailable.\n  * Media upload now logs per-file results and continues on individual failures.\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n<!-- greptile_comment -->\n\n<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>\n\n<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>\n\nthis PR addresses three critical bugs: authentication retry loops, media upload support, and mention reply handling\n\n**key changes:**\n- **auth fix (src/base.ts):** added error throwing when authentication succeeds but verification fails, preventing infinite retry loops\n- **media upload (5 files):** implemented media upload using Twitter API v1 (since v2 doesn't support it), uploads media first then passes `mediaIds` to tweet creation\n- **mention/reply handling (src/interactions.ts):** added `TWITTER_AUTO_RESPOND_MENTIONS` and `TWITTER_AUTO_RESPOND_REPLIES` settings, added `messageService` null check\n\n**critical issue found:**\n- the logic for distinguishing mentions from replies (line 514 in src/interactions.ts) is flawed - it treats any tweet with `inReplyToStatusId` as a \"reply to us\", even if it's actually a reply to someone else's tweet that mentions the bot. this needs to verify that `inReplyToStatusId` belongs to one of the bot's own tweets\n\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\n\n- this PR is mostly safe but contains a logic bug in mention/reply classification that could cause incorrect filtering behavior\n- the auth fix and media upload implementation are solid, but the mention/reply distinction logic has a critical flaw that will misclassify tweets. the code won't crash but will filter tweets incorrectly based on the AUTO_RESPOND settings\n- src/interactions.ts requires attention to fix the mention/reply classification logic at line 514\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| src/interactions.ts | added AUTO_RESPOND settings filtering and messageService null check, but mention/reply distinction logic is flawed |\n| src/base.ts | added error throwing when auth succeeds but verification fails, preventing infinite retry loop |\n| src/post.ts | implemented media upload using v1 API with proper error handling and logging |\n| src/services/PostService.ts | implemented media upload using v1 API, consistent with src/post.ts implementation |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client as Client\n    participant Post as Post/PostService\n    participant TwitterV1 as Twitter API v1\n    participant TwitterV2 as Twitter API v2\n    \n    Note over Client,TwitterV2: Media Upload Flow\n    Client->>Post: post with mediaData\n    loop for each media file\n        Post->>TwitterV1: uploadMedia(buffer, mimeType)\n        TwitterV1-->>Post: mediaId\n        Post->>Post: collect mediaIds\n    end\n    Post->>TwitterV2: sendTweet(text, replyId, mediaData, false, mediaIds)\n    TwitterV2->>TwitterV2: create tweet with media_ids\n    TwitterV2-->>Post: tweet result\n    Post-->>Client: success\n```\n\n<sub>Last reviewed commit: f35351a</sub>\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<sub>(2/5) Greptile learns from your feedback when you react with thumbs up/down!</sub>\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
