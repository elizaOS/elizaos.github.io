# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused on improving platform consistency and developer experience. The Twitter plugin was updated to use the standard `runtime.handleMessage()` function, aligning it with other ElizaOS plugins for better maintainability. A significant CLI installation issue that was blocking developers was identified and resolved with a new package release. Additionally, work has begun on a new feature to enable media uploads, expanding the plugin's capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
### Platform Standardization
To ensure uniformity and maintainability across the ElizaOS ecosystem, the plugin was updated to consistently use `runtime.handleMessage()` for all message processing. This refactoring effort ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/44)) aligns the Twitter plugin with the established pattern used by other platform plugins.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
### Closed Issues
A critical developer experience issue was resolved this week.
- **CLI Module Resolution Error ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6088)):** Users reported a "Cannot find module" error after installing the `@elizaos/cli` package. The root cause was identified as a bundling problem in the published npm package. A new version of the CLI (1.6.3) was released, and users confirmed the fix resolved the installation error.

### New & Active Issues
While no new issues were formally opened, a pull request was submitted that represents significant future work:
- **Media Uploads ([#45](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/45)):** A new pull request is now under review to enable the upload of media data using the `Twitter-API-v2`.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The resolution of the CLI installation bug ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6088)) highlighted a healthy feedback loop between the project's users and maintainers. Users reported the problem, a fix was promptly released, and the community confirmed the resolution. Furthermore, the standardization of message handling ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/44)) demonstrates a commitment to the overall architectural integrity of the ElizaOS platform, reflecting strong cross-project awareness.
