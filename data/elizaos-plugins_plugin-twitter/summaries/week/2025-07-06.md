# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Weekly Report (Jul 6 - 12, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on issue triage and community support rather than new code development. A critical authentication bug related to the Twitter Client was successfully resolved, unblocking users who had migrated to V2. However, new challenges emerged regarding API usage, with users reporting inconsistent posting behavior and significant issues with hitting Twitter's API rate limits, even with search features disabled. These discussions suggest that a paid Twitter API plan may now be necessary for reliable operation, representing a significant consideration for the plugin's users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
There were no new features, bug fixes, or other code contributions merged into the project this week. All development activity was focused on investigating and discussing issues reported by the community.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week saw a mix of resolving critical bugs and identifying new operational challenges, particularly around API limits and installation.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Authentication Fix:** A key issue where the Twitter Client failed to create after the V2 migration was confirmed resolved with the 1.2.0 update, closing issue [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/36).
    - **Windows Installation:** A platform-specific installation failure on Windows was reported and quickly closed, referencing an existing fix ([#5500](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5500)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **API Rate Limits:** A major new issue ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/38)) was opened concerning `429 Too Many Requests` errors when fetching the Home timeline, even when search is disabled. Active discussion indicates users on recent versions still face this, leading to the conclusion that a paid "PRO" or "Basic" Twitter API plan might be required.
    - **Inconsistent Posting:** A separate issue ([#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/37)) was reported where the plugin stops posting after an initial burst of activity, pointing to a potential behavioral bug.
    - **Dependency Installation:** Discussion continued on dependency installation failures ([#5482](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5482)), with detailed troubleshooting steps provided for users struggling with environment setup (Node.js, `bun`, Git submodules).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was highly visible within the issue tracker this week. In issue [#5482](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5482), contributor `claude` provided extensive, detailed support to user `wtfsayo` to diagnose a complex installation problem. Similarly, the discussion in [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/38) showcases users working together to diagnose the API rate limit problem, sharing their findings about which paid Twitter API tiers resolve the issue. This demonstrates a healthy, active community focused on collaborative problem-solving.
