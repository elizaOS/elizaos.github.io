# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were centered on infrastructure stability and collaborative troubleshooting rather than new feature development. The primary focus was a deep investigation into a critical import issue stemming from a faulty dependency, `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1. Through a joint effort between users and maintainers, the root cause was identified as a problematic package publication, leading to a clear resolution path for the ecosystem. Additionally, a new pull request was opened to introduce automated dependency management, aiming to improve long-term project health and prevent similar issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features or code changes were merged this week. Development activity was focused on improving the project's maintenance infrastructure.

- **Dependency Management Automation:** A pull request [#43](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/43) was opened to add a Renovate configuration. This aims to automate the process of keeping project dependencies up-to-date, enhancing security and stability with minimal manual intervention.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week was dominated by the investigation of a single, high-impact active issue. No new issues were opened, and none were closed.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved or closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Investigation into `@elizaos/core` Import Errors ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6031)):** A significant portion of the week was dedicated to diagnosing this issue. User `matteo-brandolino` reported that using `@elizaos/cli` v1.6.1 caused numerous import errors, with core components like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` appearing as not exported from `@elizaos/core`. After collaborative debugging, which included running `tsc --noEmit` to reveal missing type definitions, the root cause was identified: the `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1 package was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. The recommended solution is for users to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli` v1.6.2 or later and for the core team to consider deprecating the faulty version.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong community collaboration in diagnosing a complex issue. The discussion on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6031) showcased a healthy feedback loop, with user `matteo-brandolino` providing detailed error logs and environment information. Contributors `0xbbjoker`, `wtfsayo`, and `claude` worked together to guide the investigation, attempt reproduction, and ultimately deliver a conclusive root cause analysis. This collaborative effort was crucial in identifying a problem that originated outside the plugin's repository and providing a clear path forward for all developers in the ElizaOS ecosystem.
