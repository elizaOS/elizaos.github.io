# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity was centered on discussion and problem analysis rather than code implementation. While no new code was merged, significant progress was made in architecting solutions for core challenges, including a proposal for a new synchronous agent-to-agent communication endpoint. A recurring database issue, where the plugin fails on `insert into "memories"` queries, emerged as a key challenge, highlighted by a newly opened issue that echoes an existing problem. The community's focus was on diagnosing and planning fixes for these foundational and persistent issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features, bug fixes, or code refactoring were merged this week. Development efforts were concentrated on analyzing existing issues and formulating solutions in discussions.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project's focus was on diagnosing complex issues, with no issues closed during this period.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved or closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Database Interaction Errors:** A critical theme this week is the plugin's faulty interaction with the SQL database. A new issue, [#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/39), was opened reporting an `insert into "memories"` query failure. This directly relates to the ongoing active issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31), which describes a Twitter client initialization failure accompanied by the same database error, indicating a persistent blocker.
  - **Core Architecture Discussions:**
    - **Agent-to-Agent Communication ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5584)):** A detailed solution was proposed to enable direct, synchronous communication between agents, eliminating the need for polling. The proposal includes a new OpenAI-compatible endpoint that uses an `X-Agent-ID` header for specific agent targeting.
    - **Plugin Schema Migration ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588)):** Analysis continued on why custom plugin schemas fail to migrate. The root cause appears to be the `DatabaseMigrationService` not being correctly registered. Proposed solutions involve ensuring correct plugin dependencies, load order, and schema structure.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident through in-depth discussions on complex technical issues. The lack of code commits was offset by detailed proposals and debugging efforts within issues like [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5584) (agent communication) and [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588) (schema migration). This indicates a healthy, engaged community focused on resolving core architectural challenges before proceeding with implementation.
