# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on critical issue triage and architectural planning rather than code implementation. While no new code was merged, significant progress was made in discussions on core functionalities. Detailed solutions were proposed for enhancing agent-to-agent communication and resolving custom plugin schema migration challenges. A recurring SQL database error related to the Twitter plugin has emerged as a key challenge, with a new issue opened that mirrors an existing active one, indicating a potential blocker for users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the available reports, there were no new features, bug fixes, or other code-based developments merged this week. The project's focus was on analyzing and discussing existing issues.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week was defined by active discussion and the identification of a recurring bug. No issues were closed.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Recurring Database Errors:** A new issue, [#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/39), was opened concerning a Twitter error caused by a failed SQL `insert into "memories"` query. This problem is echoed in the ongoing active issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31), where multiple users also report initialization errors tied to the "memories" table, suggesting a persistent bug.
    - **Agent Communication Strategy:** Discussion in [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5584) advanced significantly with a comprehensive proposal from user @claude. The solution outlines a new OpenAI-compatible endpoint to enable direct, synchronous communication between agents, eliminating the need for polling.
    - **Plugin Schema Migration:** In [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588), @claude provided a detailed analysis of schema migration failures, identifying root causes related to service registration and proposing concrete solutions and workarounds.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
- Community engagement was strong on the issue-tracking front. User @claude played a pivotal role by providing in-depth technical analysis and potential solutions for two complex architectural issues ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5584), [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588)).
- Collaboration was also evident in issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31), where users @yasir23 and @joaoCarvalho1000 confirmed they were experiencing the same bug, helping to establish the scope of the problem.
