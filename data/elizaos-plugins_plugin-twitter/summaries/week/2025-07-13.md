# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week saw no new code contributions, with development efforts focused entirely on discussion and problem-solving within project issues. A significant theme emerged around database integration, with a new issue [#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/39) and an active one [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31) both pointing to a recurring SQL error when inserting into the "memories" table. On the architectural front, substantial progress was made through detailed proposals for enhancing agent-to-agent communication ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5584)) and resolving custom plugin schema migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588)).

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
There were no new features, bug fixes, or other code-based developments merged during this reporting period. All progress was confined to issue discussions and planning.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The focus this week was on diagnosing existing problems and planning future architectural improvements.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Recurring Database Errors:** A new issue, [#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/39), was opened due to a Twitter error caused by a failing `insert into "memories"` SQL query. This problem is closely related to the active issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31), which reports a "Twitter Client Initialization Error" linked to the same database operation, indicating a potential systemic issue with the plugin's database interaction.
    - **Agent Communication Architecture:** Discussion in [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5584) advanced significantly with a comprehensive proposal from `@claude` to implement a new OpenAI-compatible `/api/openai/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. This would enable direct, synchronous agent-to-agent communication, removing the need for polling the message bus.
    - **Plugin Schema Migration:** In [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588), `@claude` provided a detailed analysis of schema migration failures, identifying the root causes and proposing several solutions, including proper service registration and dependency declaration.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
While there were no code contributions, the project saw active engagement in issue discussions.
- Contributor `@claude` played a pivotal role by providing in-depth analysis and detailed solution proposals for two complex architectural issues ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5584), [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588)).
- Users remain engaged in reporting bugs, as evidenced by the new issue [#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/39) and continued reports from users like `@yasir23` and `@joaoCarvalho1000` on existing issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31).
