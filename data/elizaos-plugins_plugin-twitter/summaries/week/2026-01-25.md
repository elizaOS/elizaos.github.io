# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Weekly Report (Jan 25 - 31, 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week, development focused on enhancing the security and flexibility of the Twitter plugin through the introduction of a new authentication mode. A significant portion of the activity involved cross-repository troubleshooting to resolve critical project initialization failures affecting the CLI. By coordinating fixes across the plugin, core framework, and documentation, the team restored the onboarding experience for users on the latest version of ElizaOS.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### Authentication & Security
The plugin's connectivity capabilities are being expanded to support more robust enterprise and automated workflows.
*   **Broker Authentication:** A significant new feature was introduced in PR [#47](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/47), which implements a broker authentication mode. This update includes offline tests to ensure the reliability of the authentication handshake without requiring active network calls during the CI/CD process.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
*   **Project Generation & CLI Stability:** The primary focus for issue resolution this week was a critical failure in the `elizaos create` command. Users reported an inability to generate new projects despite being on version 1.7.2.
    *   **Root Cause:** Investigation into Issue [#6388](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6388) revealed a broken CLI wrapper.
    *   **Resolution:** While a temporary workaround was provided (`bun -i g @elizaos/cli`), permanent fixes were deployed via ElizaOS core PR [#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389) and documentation updates in PR [#83](https://github.com/elizaOS/docs/pull/83).

### New & Active Issues
*   The team continues to monitor the stability of the CLI wrapper following the recent patches to ensure that the "Project Generation Failure" does not recur for new users entering the ecosystem.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was characterized by rapid, cross-functional troubleshooting. The resolution of the project generation issue demonstrated tight synchronization between the plugin maintainers and the core ElizaOS team. This effort spanned three different repositories (plugin-twitter, core, and docs), highlighting a modular but highly integrated approach to maintaining the developer experience. The active discussion on Issue [#6388](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6388) served as the catalyst for these systemic improvements.
