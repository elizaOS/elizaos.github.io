# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's efforts focused on foundational infrastructure and collaborative problem-solving. A significant step was taken to automate dependency management with the introduction of a Renovate configuration. Concurrently, community-driven investigation made progress in diagnosing a critical import error affecting users of a specific Eliza CLI version, identifying potential causes and effective workarounds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving project maintenance and stability.

- **Dependency Management Automation**
  To ensure the project's dependencies remain current and secure with less manual effort, a pull request ([#43](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/43)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration. This will automate the process of creating pull requests for dependency updates.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on investigating a key compatibility problem.

- **Closed Issues:**
  No issues were closed during this reporting period.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  No new issues were opened. However, significant discussion occurred on an active issue, [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6031), concerning import errors when using the plugin with Eliza CLI v1.6.1. Investigation suggests the root cause may be a bug within the `@Elizaos/core` package itself, specifically related to type definition files. Workarounds, such as downgrading to v1.5.15 or upgrading to a version newer than 1.6.1, were identified, providing a path forward for affected users.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
