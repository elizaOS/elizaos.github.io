# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month focused on stability and addressing critical user-reported issues. While no new features were developed, significant effort was directed toward troubleshooting problems related to the Twitter API and the plugin's installation process. A key client authentication bug was resolved, but new challenges emerged concerning API rate limits and inconsistent posting behavior. These issues have sparked important community discussions about the plugin's dependency on paid Twitter API tiers and its core reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features, bug fixes, or refactoring efforts were merged this month. Development activity was concentrated on investigating and discussing issues reported by the community, with a focus on support and triage rather than new code contributions.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project's issue tracker was active this month, with a mix of resolved critical bugs and newly identified challenges related to the external Twitter API.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Authentication Fix:** A critical issue preventing the Twitter Client from being created was resolved, with the fix confirmed in the 1.2.0 update ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/36)).
    - **Windows Installation:** An installation failure specific to the Windows environment was promptly reported and closed ([#5500](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5500)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **API Rate Limits:** The most significant ongoing issue is the plugin exceeding Twitter API rate limits, causing "Too Many Requests" errors even with search disabled ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/38)). The discussion has evolved to consider whether a paid "PRO" or "Basic" Twitter API subscription is now required for the plugin to function, representing a potential blocker for many users.
    - **Inconsistent Posting:** A new bug was reported where the plugin stops posting after an initial period, indicating a potential reliability issue in its core functionality ([#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/37)).
    - **Dependency & Setup:** An active issue regarding dependency installation failures received detailed troubleshooting steps, highlighting specific requirements like `bun`, Node.js v23.3.0, and the use of WSL 2 on Windows ([#5482](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5482)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community interaction was centered on collaborative troubleshooting within GitHub issues. Users were instrumental in reporting detailed bugs, such as the API rate limit errors ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/38)) and confirming the effectiveness of fixes ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/36)). In response, maintainers provided extensive support, including a detailed troubleshooting guide for complex dependency installation problems ([#5482](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5482)), demonstrating a healthy feedback loop between the project's users and its development team.
