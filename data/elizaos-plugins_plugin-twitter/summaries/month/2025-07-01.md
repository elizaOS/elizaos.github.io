# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of significant technical advancement and critical stability challenges for the Twitter plugin. The primary achievement was a major refactoring effort that completed the migration to the official Twitter API v2, streamlining the codebase by removing over 3,500 lines of legacy code. However, this progress was coupled with persistent and widespread "Client Initialization Errors" that prevented users from running agents autonomously, making plugin stability the central challenge. Community engagement was high, with numerous users reporting issues and contributors stepping up to address documentation and tooling consistency across the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This month's development focused on modernizing the plugin's core and its testing infrastructure.

-   **Migration to Twitter API v2:** The plugin underwent a major refactor to finalize its transition from unofficial GraphQL endpoints to the official Twitter API v2. This cleanup effort, completed in PR [#33](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/33), removed a substantial amount of legacy code, improving the plugin's maintainability and aligning it with current Twitter standards.
-   **Testing Infrastructure Modernization:** In an effort to standardize tooling, work began on overhauling the plugin's testing framework. A new issue ([#34](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/34)) was opened to address test coverage, leading to a pull request ([#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/35)) aimed at migrating the test setup from Vitest to Bun, aligning it with the preferred environment of the broader ElizaOS project.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The issue tracker was highly active, reflecting the instability users faced following recent updates. While some foundational issues were resolved, critical bugs remain a top priority.

-   **Closed Issues:** Key problems resolved this month include a critical bug preventing Twitter Client creation, which was fixed with the 1.2.0 update ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/36)). Progress was also made on the developer experience by resolving inconsistent `bun run test` behavior across packages ([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5218]) and implementing client hot reloads in the development environment ([#4889](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/4889]).

-   **New & Active Issues:** The most significant challenge this month has been the persistent **Twitter Client Initialization Error** ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31)). Despite attempts to fix it, the issue evolved, with updates reportedly introducing new problems, such as SQL database errors during memory insertion ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/39)). This remains a major blocker for users. Other significant new issues include:
    -   **API Rate Limits:** Users reported hitting 429 "Too Many Requests" errors even with search disabled, pointing to potential issues with how the plugin manages API calls ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/38]).
    -   **Inconsistent Functionality:** A report was filed that the plugin stops posting after an initial burst, indicating a potential reliability issue ([#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/37]).
    -   **Deprecated Code:** An issue was opened noting that the core system was still calling a deprecated plugin method, `fetchSearchTweets` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/32]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community collaboration was a defining feature of the month, with active participation in both bug reporting and development efforts.

-   Multiple users actively contributed to issue threads, particularly for the client initialization error ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31)), by confirming the bug and providing additional context, which is crucial for diagnosis.
-   There was an encouraging trend of contributors like @Ifechukwudaniel and @ai16z-demirix requesting assignment to foundational issues related to documentation overhaul ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5234]) and CLI consistency ([#5295](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5295), [#5218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5218]).
-   Contributor @claude provided several comprehensive analyses on complex, system-wide issues, including API endpoint verification ([#5230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5230]) and custom plugin schema migration ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588]), demonstrating deep technical leadership within the community.
