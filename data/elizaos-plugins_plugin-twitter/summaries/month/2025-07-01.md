# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July's development efforts were centered on addressing critical bugs and user-reported issues rather than new feature implementation. The primary focus was on improving the plugin's stability and usability. A significant client authentication bug was resolved, unblocking users who had migrated to V2. However, new challenges emerged concerning API rate limits and posting inconsistencies, sparking active community discussion around the plugin's interaction with the Twitter API and the potential need for paid API subscriptions to ensure reliable operation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features, refactoring, or performance enhancements were merged this month. All development activity was concentrated on investigating and resolving issues reported by the community.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The month saw a strong focus on identifying and resolving user-facing problems, with several key issues being opened and closed.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Authentication & Installation Fixes:** A critical issue preventing the Twitter Client from being created was resolved with the 1.2.0 update, fixing a major regression ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/36)). Additionally, a Windows-specific installation problem was promptly addressed and closed ([#5500](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5500)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **API Rate Limits:** The most significant ongoing issue is the plugin exceeding Twitter API rate limits, causing "Too Many Requests" errors ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/38)). Discussions indicate the plugin attempts to fetch the home timeline even when disabled, and users are investigating whether paid "PRO" or "Basic" Twitter API plans are now required for functionality.
    - **Posting & Installation Problems:** A new issue was opened regarding inconsistent posting behavior where the plugin stops after a few initial posts ([#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/37)). Separately, an active discussion continued around dependency installation failures, with detailed troubleshooting guides being shared to help users with environment setup ([#5482](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5482)).
