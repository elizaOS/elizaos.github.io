# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month focused on diagnostics and user support rather than new feature development. No new code was merged into the plugin; instead, efforts were concentrated on identifying and discussing critical bugs reported by the community. Key challenges that emerged include persistent Twitter API rate limit errors, database integration failures, and complex installation issues. While several problems were resolved through configuration advice and previous updates, significant discussions have laid the groundwork for addressing core plugin stability and interaction with the broader ElizaOS framework.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
There were no new features, bug fixes, or other code contributions merged into the project this month. All development activity was confined to investigating and discussing issues.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project saw significant activity in issue tracking, with a focus on stability, authentication, and API limitations.

- **Closed Issues:** Two notable issues were resolved this month.
    - **Authentication:** A critical Twitter client authentication failure, introduced after the migration to API V2, was confirmed to be fixed with the 1.2.0 update, closing issue [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/36).
    - **Installation:** A Windows-specific installation problem was reported and closed, with the fix referenced in another pull request ([#5500](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5500)).

- **New & Active Issues:** Several critical issues were reported and discussed, highlighting key areas for future work.
    - **API Rate Limits:** A major ongoing discussion in [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/38) revolves around the plugin exceeding Twitter API rate limits, causing `429 Too Many Requests` errors. The investigation revealed the plugin attempts to fetch the home timeline even when disabled, and discussion has shifted towards the necessity of a paid Twitter API plan.
    - **Database Errors:** Multiple users reported errors related to SQL database integration. Issues [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31) and [#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/39) both point to failures during `insert into "memories"` queries, preventing the plugin from functioning correctly.
    - **Installation & Dependencies:** Issue [#5482](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5482) highlighted dependency installation failures. This led to a detailed troubleshooting guide being provided, emphasizing specific versions of `bun` and Node.js, indicating a complex setup process.
    - **Core Framework Challenges:** Broader architectural discussions took place in issues [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5584) and [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588). These conversations, led by contributor `claude`, explored solutions for direct agent-to-agent communication and proper custom plugin schema migration, indicating that some plugin issues are rooted in the core ElizaOS framework.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community interaction was highly active within GitHub Issues this month. Users were diligent in reporting bugs related to installation, API limits, and database errors. Contributor `claude` played a central role in triaging these reports, providing comprehensive troubleshooting steps for installation issues ([#5482](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5482)) and offering detailed architectural proposals to address core framework limitations affecting plugins ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5584), [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588)). This collaborative troubleshooting demonstrates a healthy and responsive feedback loop between users and maintainers, even in the absence of immediate code fixes.
