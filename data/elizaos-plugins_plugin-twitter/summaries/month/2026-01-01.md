# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Monthly Report (January 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
In January 2026, the `plugin-twitter` project focused on modernizing its core infrastructure by implementing more secure authentication protocols. The primary achievement was the introduction of OAuth2 PKCE support, which aligns with ElizaOS's mission of building secure, autonomous AI agents. This update significantly improves the developer experience by enabling a 3-legged "login + approve" flow, reducing the risks associated with client secret management while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### Authentication & Security Infrastructure
The month's technical efforts were centered on transitioning the plugin toward modern authentication standards to enhance security and flexibility for Twitter/X integrations.

*   **OAuth2 PKCE Implementation:** The team successfully integrated OAuth2 with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). This development allows for secure authentication without the need to ship client secrets, facilitating a more robust "login + approve" workflow. The implementation was designed to be non-breaking, ensuring that existing OAuth 1.0a environment variable configurations continue to function as expected. This involved comprehensive updates to authentication providers and client-side logic ([#46](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/46)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

*   **Closed Issues:** No specific issues were closed during this period, as the primary focus was on the major architectural enhancement of the authentication system.
*   **New & Active Issues:** There were no new issues reported or significant active discussions on existing issues during the reported timeframe.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The development activity this month was characterized by high-impact architectural work. The successful merge of the OAuth2 PKCE PR ([#46](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/46)) demonstrates a commitment to maintaining a secure and modular framework. While the reported data shows a focused period of development on core security features, the project continues to prioritize stability for its existing user base by ensuring backward compatibility during major feature rollouts.
