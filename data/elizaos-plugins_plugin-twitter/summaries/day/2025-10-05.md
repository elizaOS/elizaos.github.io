### Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61
Discussion continued on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6031) regarding `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61`. The latest comment from matteo-brandolino suggests the issue might stem from type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing source files not included in the published package. Downgrading to version 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 of `@Elizaos/core` appears to resolve the problem, indicating a potential bug specific to version 1.6.1. Previously, 0xbbjoker confirmed it worked on their setup with 1.6.1 and provided troubleshooting steps.
