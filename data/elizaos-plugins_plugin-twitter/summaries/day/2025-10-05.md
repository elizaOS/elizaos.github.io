## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61 [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6031)
Discussion continued regarding import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61. The user `matteo-brandolino` suggested the issue might stem from missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing non-existent `src` directories in `dist/index.d.ts` and `dist/types/index.d.ts`. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem. `0xbbjoker` requested `matteo-brandolino` to run `bun x tsc --noEmit` to further diagnose, suspecting an IDE TSC compiler issue. `matteo-brandolino` provided the output of `bun x tsc --noEmit`, which showed 28 errors across 4 files, primarily indicating that numerous members like `logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, `Project`, `Character`, `UUID`, `Plugin`, `Action`, `ActionResult`, `Content`, `GenerateTextParams`, `HandlerCallback`, `Memory`, `ModelType`, `Provider`, `ProviderResult`, `Service`, and `State` are not exported from `@elizaos/core`. The user also questioned if the issue was with their IDE's TSC compiler, given that previous and later versions of Eliza CLI do not exhibit the same problem.
