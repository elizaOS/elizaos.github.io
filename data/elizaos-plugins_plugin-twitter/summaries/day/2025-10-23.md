# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Oct 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The Twitter plugin saw a key feature addition today, standardizing message processing across the ElizaOS platform. An important CLI issue was also resolved, improving the developer experience.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Standardized Message Processing
The Twitter plugin now consistently uses `runtime.handleMessage()` for message processing, aligning with the established pattern across all ElizaOS platform plugins. This ensures uniformity and maintainability. ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/44))

Issue [#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6088), "Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code' after installing elizaOS CLI," was actively discussed and resolved today. Users reported encountering this error after installing the ElizaOS CLI. The issue was identified as a bundling problem in the published npm package. A new version (1.6.3) was released, which fixed the problem. Users confirmed that running `bun install -g @elizaos/cli` again resolved the issue.
