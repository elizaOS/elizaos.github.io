# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Oct 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The Twitter plugin saw a key feature addition today, standardizing message processing with `runtime.handleMessage()`. This aligns the plugin with the core ElizaOS platform's architectural patterns.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Standardized Message Processing
The Twitter plugin now utilizes `runtime.handleMessage()` for all message processing, ensuring consistency with other ElizaOS platform plugins. This change improves modularity and adherence to established architectural patterns. ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/44))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### CLI Module Resolution Error ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6088))
Users continue to report issues with the ElizaOS CLI failing to find the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` module after installation. A new version (1.6.3) was released today to address this, and one user confirmed the fix after re-running `bun install -g @elizaos/cli`. Previously, workarounds involved using a local clone of the repository or directly executing the CLI from its `dist` folder. The root cause was identified as a bundling issue in the published npm package.
