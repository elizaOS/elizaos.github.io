## NEW ISSUES
### Twitter Client Creation Failure
A new issue was reported concerning the failure to create a Twitter client after migrating an agent to V2 and updating the plugin to 1.0.14. Users are encountering an error despite successful authentication with the Twitter API v2. This issue appears to be a recurrence or a related problem to previously reported client initialization errors. [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/36)

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Plugin Loading Failures on Windows
Discussions continued on the issue of `@elizaos/plugin-openai` and `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` failing to load on Windows. A user reproduced the issue and is actively researching a fix, providing screenshots to illustrate the problem. Another user confirmed the issue persists even with the 1.0.19 release and offered to provide more debugging information. [#5407](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5407)

### Twitter Client Initialization Error
The ongoing issue of Twitter client initialization errors received further comments. A user reported that while the latest 1.0.14 `plugin-twitter` was intended to fix a previous error, it introduced a new one related to memory insertion during client creation. Other users continued to report the same client initialization error, indicating the problem is widespread and not fully resolved by recent updates. Concerns were raised about the ability to run agents autonomously on Twitter due to these persistent issues. [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31)
