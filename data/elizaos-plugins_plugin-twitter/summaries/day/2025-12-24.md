## NEW ISSUES

### Agent Chat and Conversation Management
Two new issues were opened concerning agent chat functionality. One addresses the need for opening the most recent conversation when accessing an agent from "My Agents/Dashboard" ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6281)). The other highlights a problem where conversations with one agent are duplicated on another when switching between them ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6282)).

### User Interface and Documentation Improvements
Two additional issues were created. One reports issues with spacing in numbered items within the UI ([#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6283)). The other aims to fix monorepo documentation ([#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6284)).
