## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Dependency Installation Failures
Discussion continued on an issue regarding dependency installation failures with an exit code 1. A detailed troubleshooting guide was provided by `claude`, emphasizing the requirement for `bun` as the package manager, Node.js version 23.3.0, and proper `bun` installation. The guide also covered Git submodule issues, platform-specific considerations (WSL 2 for Windows), clean installation steps, and environment variables. The user `wtfsayo` requested `claude` to look into the issue and also inquired about the ElizaOS version. ([#5482](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5482))
