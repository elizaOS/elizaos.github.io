## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6031))
The discussion on this issue concluded with confirmation that the type errors experienced with Eliza CLI 1.61 are no longer occurring after a clean reinstall of dependencies or creating a fresh project. The user `matteo-brandolino` reported that both approaches now work correctly. `wtfsayo` acknowledged this, suggesting that such errors can often be attributed to node/package type resolution issues and that no specific fix was implemented on their end. This indicates that the problem was likely environmental or related to cached dependencies rather than a persistent bug in the ElizaOS core.
