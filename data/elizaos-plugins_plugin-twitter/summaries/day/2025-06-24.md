## OVERVIEW

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new technical developments were completed today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Documentation Strategy Refinement
A proposal for a documentation overhaul, aiming to create separate tracks for simple users and developers, was closed today. This suggests a decision has been made or the work has been integrated elsewhere. ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5234))

### Custom Plugin Development Challenges
An issue concerning the creation of a custom plugin for an on-chain AI agent, specifically difficulties with Eliza supporting only one message before stopping plugin usage, was closed. A comment suggests the issue might be related to how responses are sent (callback vs. return). ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5260))

## NEW ISSUES
### Twitter Plugin Reply Functionality
A new issue was reported where the Twitter plugin loads successfully but fails to reply to mentions, tags, or direct replies, despite relevant configuration options being enabled. No errors are displayed, and the plugin appears to be running. ([#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/29))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Custom Plugin Callback Interference
Discussion continued on an issue where a custom plugin's callback is being replaced by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider. The latest comments confirm the issue is still valid in the current codebase (v1.0.19). A detailed root cause analysis points to the message handler flow where the `ATTACHMENTS` provider modifies the state before it's passed to action callbacks. Recommendations include immediate fixes to isolate action callbacks from provider state, architectural changes, and adding tests. A workaround for users is to avoid attachment-related keywords or use simple responses. A potential fix is being worked on for v1.2.4, aiming to separate provider state composition from action callback processing. ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/4947))
