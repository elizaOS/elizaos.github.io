## CLOSED ISSUES

### CLI Test Command Improvements
An issue regarding inconsistent `bun run test` behavior across packages was resolved, ensuring a more reliable developer experience for running tests within individual packages. This fix addresses [#5218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5218).

### Initial Plugin Setup and Configuration
Several issues related to the initial setup and configuration of the plugin were addressed. This includes clarifying environment variable requirements like `LOAD_DOCS_ON_STARTUP` and `CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED`, and identifying a potential issue with dynamic providers. This work is captured in [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31).

## NEW ISSUES

### Twitter Client Initialization Error
A new critical issue has been reported where users are experiencing a "client initialization error" despite successful authentication with the Twitter API. This prevents agents from running autonomously on Twitter. This problem is detailed in [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CLI Test Command Monorepo Requirement
Discussion continues on [#5142](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5142) regarding the `@elizaos/cli` test command incorrectly requiring a monorepo root for standalone projects. While a user indicated it was fixed, a request was made for an investigation to confirm its current validity.

### Event Message Sent Not Working
The issue of `EventType.MESSAGE_SENT` not being emitted by `sendAgentResponseToBus` when sending payloads to the central server API endpoint is still active in [#5216](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5216). A user asked if the bootstrap plugin was added.

### CLI Input Method Consistency
The migration of remaining CLI input methods to use `@clack/prompts` for consistency, tracked in [#5295](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5295), is ongoing. A user requested to be assigned to the issue and was encouraged to work on it and submit a PR.
