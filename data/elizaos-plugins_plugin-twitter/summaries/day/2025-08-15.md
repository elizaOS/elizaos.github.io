# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Aug 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on resolving critical publishing and testing issues. Two significant issues were closed, addressing false success reports for plugin publishing and persistent testing failures. A new issue was opened regarding Twitter API rate limits.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Plugin Publishing Fixes
Resolved a critical issue where the `elizaos publish --npm` command reported success but failed to publish plugins to npm due to incorrect package naming and outdated templates. The solution involved updating the package name to be unscoped and ensuring the `package.json` matched the current plugin template structure. ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5754))

### Test Stability Improvements
Addressed recurring test failures related to WebSocket mocking. The resolution involved correctly setting up WebSocket mocks before imports, ensuring the service uses the mock instead of attempting real connections during testing. ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5770))

## NEW ISSUES

### Twitter API Rate Limiting Concerns
A new issue was opened to clarify documentation regarding Twitter API rate limits, specifically noting that a Basic Tier subscription is required to avoid rate limiting errors. The issue highlights the high cost of the Basic Tier and questions the necessity of fetching the home timeline at startup due to its impact on allocated posts. ([#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/40))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Test Stability and WebSocket Mocking ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5770))
The issue, which involved persistent test failures related to WebSocket connections, was resolved. The latest comment confirms that moving the WebSocket mock setup before imports fixed the problem, allowing the service to use the mock instead of real connections. The user also praised Eliza's "ASK AI" documentation as superior to GPT-5. Previously, guidance was provided on checking mock setup files, using consistent mocking libraries, adding debugging, and running tests individually to isolate issues, suggesting the problem was deterministic and related to mock configuration.

### Critical Plugin Publishing Failures ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5754))
This critical issue, where plugin publishing failed despite success reports, has been resolved. The latest comment confirms that the legacy plugin naming change, specifically updating the package name from a scoped `@elizaos/plugin-polygon` to an unscoped `plugin-polygon`, along with ensuring the `package.json` matched the current template, fixed the publishing problem. Earlier, detailed steps were provided to update the package name and ensure the `package.json` aligned with the latest plugin template, as the issue was attributed to scoped package name requirements and an outdated template.
