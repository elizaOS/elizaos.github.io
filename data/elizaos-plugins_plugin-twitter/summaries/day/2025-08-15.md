## CLOSED ISSUES

### Plugin Publishing Fixes
Resolved an issue where the `elizaos publish --npm` command reported success but failed to publish due to scoped package naming and outdated templates. The solution involved updating the package name to be unscoped and ensuring the `package.json` matched the current plugin template structure. ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5754))

### Test Stability Improvements
Addressed recurring test failures related to WebSocket mocking. The resolution involved correctly setting up WebSocket mocks before imports, ensuring the service uses the mock instead of attempting real connections. ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5770))

## NEW ISSUES

### Twitter API Tier Clarification
A new issue was opened to clarify documentation regarding Twitter API tier requirements. The user noted that the Free Tier has severe rate limits (1 endpoint interaction / 15 mins) and the Basic Tier is costly ($200/month), questioning if fetching the home timeline at startup can be avoided to conserve API calls. ([#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/40))
