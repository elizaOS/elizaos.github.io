## CLOSED ISSUES
### Authentication Method Clarification

The user reported that after installing the latest version, the plugin still attempted to authenticate with a password instead of API keys, suggesting an outdated version was being used from `node_modules`. This issue was resolved within the day. [#28](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/28)

## NEW ISSUES
### API Key and Credential Usage
A new issue was reported concerning the use of API keys and credentials. The user noted that despite installing the latest version of the Twitter plugin, it seemed to revert to an older version within `node_modules`, leading to password-based authentication attempts instead of API key usage. This issue was subsequently closed on the same day. [#28](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/28)

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Server API Endpoint Issues
Discussion continued on an active issue concerning "server" API endpoints returning 404 errors, with only the `get agents` endpoint seemingly working. On July 13, 2025, @wtfsayo requested @claude to verify the issue against current OpenAPI specifications and Postman files. @claude's analysis, completed on the same day, concluded that the API implementation is "fully functional and comprehensive" and that the reported 404 errors are "likely due to deployment/configuration issues, not missing endpoints." @claude provided a detailed summary of verified implementations, documentation status, likely root causes (server initialization, environment configuration, port/network issues, database problems), diagnostic steps, and recommendations for troubleshooting. This comprehensive response suggests the issue is environmental rather than a code defect. [#5230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5230)
