## NEW ISSUES
### Twitter Plugin Database Error
A new issue was reported concerning a Twitter error related to the SQL database, specifically an `insert into "memories"` query failure. This suggests a potential problem with how the Twitter plugin interacts with the database for storing information. [#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/39)

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Agent-to-Agent Communication Without Polling
Discussion continued on the challenge of forwarding messages between agents without polling. A detailed solution was proposed and implemented, introducing a new OpenAI-compatible endpoint for direct, synchronous agent-to-agent communication. This new endpoint aims to eliminate polling, support streaming, and allow specific agent targeting via an `X-Agent-ID` header. The solution involves direct runtime access, message conversion, state composition, and response generation, with new files created for the router, documentation, and examples.

### Custom Plugin Schema Migration Issues
Analysis of custom plugin schema migration issues revealed that the `DatabaseMigrationService` is not registered as a runtime service in the SQL plugin, leading to skipped agent-level migrations. Solutions proposed include ensuring proper plugin schema structure with a `schema` export, declaring dependencies on `@elizaos/plugin-sql`, and setting a higher priority. Workarounds like manual database schema creation or server-level plugin registration were also suggested. The discussion emphasized the importance of correct plugin loading order and provided debugging steps. [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588)

### Twitter Client Initialization Error
Users continue to report a Twitter client initialization error despite successful authentication. The error message indicates a failure to create the Twitter client, often accompanied by a database query error related to inserting into "memories." This suggests a persistent issue with the Twitter plugin's ability to fully initialize and interact with the database after authentication.
