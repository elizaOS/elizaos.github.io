## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Agent-to-Agent Communication Enhancements
Discussion on [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5584) focused on forwarding messages between agents without polling. @claude provided a comprehensive solution by implementing a new OpenAI-compatible `/api/openai/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. This solution aims to enable direct, synchronous agent-to-agent communication, bypassing the message bus and supporting streaming. Key features include OpenAI compatibility, direct agent access via `X-Agent-ID` header, and no polling requirement.

### Custom Plugin Schema Migration Challenges
The issue [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588) regarding custom plugin schema migration issues received a detailed analysis from @claude. The root causes were identified as the `DatabaseMigrationService` not being registered as a runtime service and improper plugin schema integration. Solutions proposed include ensuring proper plugin schema structure, declaring plugin dependencies, and server-level plugin registration. Workarounds like manual database schema creation or modifying server initialization were also suggested.

### Twitter Client Initialization Errors
Issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31) continues to be active, with users reporting "Twitter Client Initialization Error" despite successful authentication. The error message indicates a failure to insert into the "memories" table. Users @yasir23 and @joaoCarvalho1000 reported experiencing the same issue. Previous comments suggested that plugin version 1.0.14 might fix some issues but introduced new ones related to database queries.
