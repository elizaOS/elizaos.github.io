# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Jan 9, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, significant progress was made with the addition of OAuth2 PKCE authentication, enhancing security and flexibility for Twitter integration.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Authentication with OAuth2 PKCE
A new OAuth2 PKCE authentication mode has been implemented, providing a more secure and modern way to handle Twitter/X authentication. This feature allows for 3-legged "login + approve" without shipping client secrets, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing OAuth 1.0a environment variable configurations. This involved extensive changes across authentication providers and related client files. ([#46](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/46))
