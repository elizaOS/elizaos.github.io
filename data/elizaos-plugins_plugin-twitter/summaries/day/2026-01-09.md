# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Jan 9, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the `plugin-twitter` repository saw a significant feature addition with the implementation of OAuth2 PKCE authentication, enhancing security and maintaining backward compatibility.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Authentication with OAuth2 PKCE
A major feature was introduced to support 3-legged "login + approve" Twitter/X authentication using OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code + PKCE. This update improves security by not shipping any client secret while ensuring full backward compatibility with the existing OAuth 1.0a environment variable setup. This involved extensive changes across authentication providers and related client components. ([#46](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/46))
