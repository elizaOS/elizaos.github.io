## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Excessive Home Timeline Fetching and API Limits
Discussions continue around the issue of the plugin attempting to fetch the Home timeline even when `search enabled` is set to `false`, leading to 429 API limit errors. Recent comments indicate that users on version 1.2.16 are still experiencing "Too Many Requests" errors. The conversation has shifted to whether a "PRO" or "Basic" (paid) Twitter API subscription is required to mitigate these rate limits, with one user confirming that the $200/month tier works. The rate limit for this tier is being questioned. ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/38))
