## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Timeline Fetching and API Rate Limits
Discussions continue around the issue of failing to fetch the Home timeline, leading to 429 API limit errors, even when the search is disabled. Users are reporting that this issue persists with version 1.2.16, which was intended to introduce a new system for timeline fetching. There's an ongoing conversation about whether a "PRO" or "Basic" Twitter subscription tier is required to avoid these rate limits, with one user confirming that the $200/month "Basic" tier works. The rate limit for this tier is being questioned. ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/38))
