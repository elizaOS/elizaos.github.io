### Investigation into `@elizaos/core` Import Errors [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6031)
The discussion on this issue continued with `matteo-brandolino` confirming their OS as Arch Linux. `wtfsayo` had previously inquired about the OS, and `matteo-brandolino` provided their Node (v24.9.0), Bun (1.2.22), and OS (x86_64 Arch Linux) details. A detailed diagnosis by `claude` concluded that the root cause for the import errors in `index.ts` with Eliza CLI 1.61 is due to missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1. The exports (`logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, etc.) are present in the source code but were not properly exposed in the published package's `.d.ts` files. This issue is specific to version 1.6.1 and is environment-independent. Recommendations include upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later and for the ElizaOS team to consider deprecating v1.6.1 and adding publish-time validation.
