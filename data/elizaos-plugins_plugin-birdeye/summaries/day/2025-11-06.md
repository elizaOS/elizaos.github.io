# elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye Daily Update (Nov 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant refactoring of the Birdeye plugin's initialization and service wiring to use a config-driven approach, alongside a crucial bug fix to ensure safe task scheduling and cleanup.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Plugin Initialization and Service Refactoring
The plugin underwent a major refactoring to introduce a `BirdeyeService` with config-driven initialization. This change also integrated new providers for wallet portfolio, market overview, and multi-chain trending data, complete with caching mechanisms. This enhances modularity and scalability. ([#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye/pull/6))

### Task Management and Cleanup Fix
A bug related to task management was addressed, deferring Birdeye task cleanup and `BIRDEYE_SYNC_WALLET` registration until `runtime.initPromise` resolves. This ensures that old tasks are safely removed and new tasks are scheduled without conflicts during initialization. ([#7](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye/pull/7))
