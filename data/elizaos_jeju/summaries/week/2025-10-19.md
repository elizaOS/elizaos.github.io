# elizaos/jeju Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week marked a significant milestone for the `jeju` project with a massive initial commit that established the foundational architecture for new applications and infrastructure. The centerpiece of this effort was the introduction of the `bazaar` application, complete with a comprehensive UI, multi-chain support, and token management. Alongside this foundational code, strategic issues were opened to guide future development, focusing on critical areas like agent security, performance load testing, and adversarial "Redteam" agent testing.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### Initial Project Scaffolding and `bazaar` Application
A substantial foundational commit ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos/jeju/pull/1)) was merged, laying the groundwork for the project. This single effort introduced a wide array of new features and infrastructure, including:
- **`bazaar` Application:** A new application featuring a comprehensive set of UI components, multi-chain configurations, and token management functionalities.
- **CI/CD Workflows:** New GitHub Actions were added to automate multi-chain tests, node operator continuous integration, and service integration testing.
- **Coding Standards:** Initial `.cursor` rules were established to enforce code conventions and file organization across the repository.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
No issues were resolved or closed this week.

### New & Active Issues
The focus of new discussions centered on ensuring the long-term reliability and security of the AI agent framework. Three key issues were opened to kickstart these efforts:
- **Performance & Scalability:** An issue was created to define requirements for comprehensive load testing, ensuring the platform can handle expected user and agent activity ([#2](https://github.com/elizaos/jeju/issues/2)).
- **Agent Security & Oversight:** A discussion began on implementing robust agent control mechanisms, such as "Guardian Agents" and "Agent Multisig," to prevent unauthorized actions ([#3](https://github.com/elizaos/jeju/issues/3)).
- **Adversarial Testing:** To proactively identify system vulnerabilities, an issue was opened to explore the creation of "Redteam Agents" for adversarial testing ([#4](https://github.com/elizaos/jeju/issues/4)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week's activity was characterized by a focused, foundational push. The primary work involved a single, large-scale commit to establish the project's initial structure. The subsequent opening of strategic issues indicates a deliberate effort to set a clear and robust roadmap for future development and contribution.
