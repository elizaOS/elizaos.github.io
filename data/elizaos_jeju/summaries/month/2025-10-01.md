# elizaos/jeju Monthly Report (October 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
October marked the foundational launch of the `jeju` repository. The month's activity was centered around a single, massive initial commit that established the project's core infrastructure, including the new `bazaar` application with multi-chain support. This foundational code drop was immediately followed by the creation of strategic issues focused on long-term agent reliability, security, and adversarial testing. This sets a clear trajectory for building a robust and secure AI agent framework from the ground up.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The development work this month consisted of establishing the initial structure and feature set for the project.

-   **Initial Project Scaffolding and `bazaar` Application:** A substantial initial commit laid the groundwork for the entire repository ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos/jeju/pull/1)). This introduced the `bazaar` application, which includes a comprehensive suite of UI components, configurations for multi-chain support, and token management functionalities. Alongside the application code, foundational infrastructure was established, including GitHub workflows for multi-chain testing, node operator CI, and service integration tests. Initial coding conventions and file organization rules were also defined.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on defining the critical pillars for future development, particularly around agent security and performance.

-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in October.

-   **New & Active Issues:** Three significant issues were opened, outlining key areas for future work:
    -   **Performance & Reliability:** The need for comprehensive load testing was identified to ensure the platform can handle expected user and agent activity ([#2](https://github.com/elizaos/jeju/issues/2)).
    -   **Agent Security & Oversight:** A crucial discussion began on implementing advanced security measures, proposing concepts like "Guardian Agents" and "Agent Multisig" for enhanced control and safety ([#3](https://github.com/elizaos/jeju/issues/3)).
    -   **Adversarial Testing:** To ensure system robustness, an issue was created to explore the development of "Redteam Agents" for proactively identifying vulnerabilities ([#4](https://github.com/elizaos/jeju/issues/4)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration in October was characterized by the initiation of foundational work and strategic planning. While the initial commit represents a significant individual contribution, the subsequent creation of key issues has opened the door for future community discussion and collaboration on core architectural concepts like agent security and testing. No issues saw significant discussion traffic this month, indicating that these conversations are in their earliest stages.
