# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development focused on improving project maintenance and investigating a critical dependency issue. A key step forward was the introduction of automated dependency management to ensure the plugin remains secure and up-to-date. Concurrently, significant effort was dedicated to diagnosing a blocking import error affecting users of a specific Eliza CLI version, with community collaboration pointing towards a root cause in the core framework.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This month's work centered on enhancing the project's long-term health and stability.

- **Dependency Management Automation**
  To streamline maintenance and improve security, a Renovate configuration was added to the repository ([#13](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/13)). This will automatically create pull requests for dependency updates, reducing the manual effort required to keep the project's dependencies current.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month was focused on a single, high-impact active issue.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in this period.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, but a significant discussion progressed on an existing one.
  - **[#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6031) - Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.6.1:** This active issue saw important analysis. The problem, which prevents the plugin from working with `@Elizaos/core` v1.6.1, is believed to stem from incorrect type definition paths within the core package itself. The investigation revealed that type files reference a `src` directory that is not included in the published npm package. It was noted that downgrading to v1.5.15 or upgrading to a version newer than 1.6.1 serves as a workaround.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the focused troubleshooting efforts around the project's dependencies.
