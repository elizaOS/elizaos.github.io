# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
August was a productive month focused on enhancing core functionality and improving developer experience for the Solana plugin. A significant expansion of utility functions provides developers with a more comprehensive toolkit for blockchain interactions. Concurrently, work was done to resolve a critical npm publishing bug that was impeding releases. These efforts collectively advanced the plugin's capabilities and stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development work this month centered on adding new features and standardizing the plugin's configuration.

- **Enhanced Solana Utility Functions:** A major feature update introduced a suite of new utility functions to streamline common Solana operations. The additions include `getAddressType`, `getTokenAccountsByKeypair`, `getBalanceByAddr`, `getMetadataAddress`, `getTokenSymbol`, `isValidSolanaAddress`, and `executeSwap` (which leverages `plugin-jupiter`), significantly expanding the plugin's capabilities ([#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/10)).

- **Service Configuration Standardization:** To improve consistency across the ElizaOS ecosystem, the internal service configuration was updated. The service was renamed to `chain_solana` to align with standard naming conventions ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/8)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on resolving critical bugs and providing support for developer testing.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Plugin Publishing Failures Resolved:** A critical issue preventing successful npm publishing was fixed. The `elizaos publish --npm` command would report success while failing silently. The root cause was an incorrect scoped package name (`@elizaos`) and an outdated plugin template. The resolution involved updating the `package.json` to use an unscoped name, unblocking the release process ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5754)).
    - **Plugin Testing Errors Resolved:** A user experiencing persistent errors with `bun test` received guidance that led to a resolution. The problem was traced to a WebSocket mock that needed to be set up before other imports. The issue was successfully closed after the user confirmed the fix ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5770)).

- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened during this period, and all previously active issues were resolved and closed.
