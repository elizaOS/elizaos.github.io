# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Monthly Report (February 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
In February 2026, development on the Solana plugin focused on maturing the core infrastructure to support more resilient and accessible AI agent operations. The primary theme of the month was the transition toward a more flexible API architecture, highlighted by the implementation of cloud proxy routing for major data providers. This shift, combined with a significant refactoring of the transaction system and enhanced metadata parsing for Token-2022, ensures that agents can maintain high uptime and data accuracy across diverse network conditions.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### API Resilience and Proxy Routing
A major architectural update introduced cloud proxy routing for Birdeye and Helius services. This implementation creates a tiered priority chain for API requests: the system first attempts to use a direct user-provided key, falls back to the Eliza Cloud proxy, and finally utilizes public endpoints. This ensures that agents remain functional even if individual API limits are reached or keys are not provided ([#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/26)).

### Transaction System & Token Standards
The core transaction engine underwent a significant refactor to improve reliability and extensibility. Key improvements include:
*   **Token-2022 Support:** Enhanced metadata parsing for the Token-2022 standard, ensuring agents can accurately interpret newer asset types on Solana.
*   **Swap Execution:** Introduction of exchange-driven swap execution logic.
*   **Network Registration:** Formal registration of Solana networks with `INTEL_CHAIN` to standardize cross-plugin communication ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/24)).

### Data Providers and Discovery
To improve the agent's ability to identify and verify assets, a new Solana Contract Address (CA) lookup provider was introduced. This provider fetches on-chain token details and is designed to activate automatically when `spartan-intel` is not present, ensuring continuous data availability ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/23)).

### Documentation and Onboarding
The project's documentation was overhauled to support the growing contributor base. The updated README now includes comprehensive guides on environment variables, installation procedures, and detailed usage examples for the plugin's various features ([#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/11)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The month was characterized by high-velocity development and internal stabilization.
*   **Closed Issues:** While no specific external issues were closed during the reported period, the merging of major PRs addressed internal technical debt regarding transaction handling and API fallback logic.
*   **New & Active Issues:** No significant blockers or controversial issues were reported in the daily logs, suggesting a stable development cycle focused on feature parity and infrastructure hardening.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was centered on core architectural decisions, particularly regarding how the plugin interacts with external data providers and the broader ElizaOS ecosystem. The integration with `INTEL_CHAIN` and the fallback logic for `spartan-intel` demonstrate a concerted effort to ensure the Solana plugin remains a modular and composable component within the larger framework. The focus on comprehensive documentation indicates a proactive approach to lowering the barrier for new contributors and users.
