# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This period saw a significant push to enhance the plugin's token handling capabilities and overall stability. The most notable achievement was the integration of advanced support for the Token-2022 standard, enabling more sophisticated token parsing and live wallet data updates. Alongside this feature enhancement, critical bug fixes were implemented to resolve TypeScript errors and improve application resilience, ensuring the plugin can operate more reliably, even when external services are unavailable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work focused on two primary themes: upgrading token management and bolstering application stability.

- **Enhanced Token-2022 Support and Wallet Data**
  A major update in [#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/14) introduced Token-2022-aware parsing, allowing the plugin to correctly handle token symbols, mutability, and supply. This effort also improved wallet management by implementing a batch symbol backfill process, combined SPL and Token-2022 account discovery, and live data updates via account subscriptions.

- **Bug Fixes and Application Resilience**
  To improve stability and the developer experience, critical TypeScript errors were resolved and logging was enhanced for better debugging. [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/15) also made the application more resilient by allowing it to continue in a standalone mode if trading services are down and by adding a clearer startup retry mechanism.
