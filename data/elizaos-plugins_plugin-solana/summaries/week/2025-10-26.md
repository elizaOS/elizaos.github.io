# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts balanced immediate stability improvements with significant foundational work for future capabilities. Development began with a critical bug fix, resolving a race condition in the wallet service to enhance reliability. The focus then shifted to improving the plugin's flexibility and developer experience by introducing lazy wallet loading and new programmatic API routes. The week concluded with the initiation of several major undertakings, including a comprehensive build process overhaul, a transaction system refactor, and initial work on multichain support, setting a clear direction for the project's next phase.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving service stability, enhancing wallet management, and laying the groundwork for major future enhancements.

### Service Stability and Wallet Management
- **Race Condition Fix:** A critical bug causing initialization failures in the `SolanaWalletService` was resolved. The fix introduces lazy loading for the `SolanaService`, ensuring its availability and preventing a race condition during startup ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/18)).
- **Enhanced Wallet Functionality:** The plugin's adaptability was improved with the introduction of lazy wallet loading and new HTTP API routes for programmatic wallet access. To improve the developer experience, TypeScript types were also added for type-safe API consumption ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/21)).
- **Version Bump:** The project version was updated to 1.2.6 as part of a routine chore update ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/19)).

### Foundational Work Initiated
A series of new pull requests were opened, signaling a push towards significant architectural and tooling improvements:
- **Build Process & Type Safety:** A major initiative began to harden the development pipeline by enabling typechecks in the build, enforcing stricter TypeScript rules, and migrating the testing framework from Vitest to Bun ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/22)).
- **Core System Refinements:** Foundational work was started on a multichain/exchange API, a refactor of the transaction system, and improvements for Token2022 ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/24)).
- **Wallet & Service Integration:** New pull requests were opened to implement lazy loading for wallet keys ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/20)) and to add a `caLookupProvider` as a fallback for when Spartan-Intel is not in use ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/23)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
  - Issue [#6096](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6096), related to implementing a unified messaging API via the ElizaOS Wrapper, was opened and subsequently closed. A related pull request in the main `elizaOS/eliza` repository suggests this work is part of a broader, cross-project initiative.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - Issue [#168](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/168) was highlighted, reporting an incorrect date range displayed on most Weekly Summaries. Team member `standujar` has acknowledged the issue and is investigating.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week saw evidence of both active maintenance and cross-ecosystem collaboration. The quick acknowledgment and investigation of issue [#168](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/168) by a team member demonstrates responsive project oversight. Furthermore, the discussion around issue [#6096](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6096) and its link to a pull request in the core `elizaOS/eliza` repository indicates tight integration and collaboration within the wider ElizaOS ecosystem. The cluster of significant foundational pull requests opened at the end of the week suggests a coordinated effort to advance the plugin's core architecture.
