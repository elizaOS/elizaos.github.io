# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on enhancing the stability and laying the groundwork for future API enhancements. A critical race condition within the wallet service was resolved, improving the plugin's reliability during initialization. Concurrently, planning for a significant architectural update began with the introduction of an issue to implement a unified messaging API, signaling a move towards greater integration with the core ElizaOS framework.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this period centered on bug fixes and routine maintenance.

- **Wallet Service Stability Fix:** A key bug was addressed in the `SolanaWalletService` which was failing to initialize correctly due to a race condition. The fix, implemented in PR [#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/18), introduces lazy loading for the `SolanaService`. This ensures the core service is available before the wallet service attempts to use it, resolving the "Solana Service is required" error.

- **Dependency Management:** The project version was bumped to 1.2.6 in a routine chore update ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/19)) with no functional changes.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue tracking this week pointed towards future development initiatives.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed within the provided activity logs.

- **New & Active Issues:** A significant new issue, [#6096](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6096), was opened to track the "Implement unified messaging API through ElizaOs Wrapper." This represents a major upcoming feature aimed at standardizing communication. The issue was noted as closed the following day, suggesting rapid progress or planning.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident through cross-repository coordination. The new issue for the unified messaging API ([#6096](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6096)) is directly linked to a pull request in the main ElizaOS repository ([elizaOS/eliza#6095](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6095)), indicating close alignment between the plugin's development and the core framework's evolution.
