# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Weekly Report (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development was centered on a significant push to modernize the project's tooling and enhance code quality. The primary effort involved migrating the testing framework from Vitest to Bun's native test runner, establishing a stricter TypeScript environment, and enabling pre-build typechecking. This foundational work improves the plugin's long-term reliability and streamlines the development process, while also delivering improvements to SOL swap handling.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
All development activity this week was consolidated into a single, impactful pull request focused on infrastructure and code quality.

- **Tooling Migration and TypeScript Hardening**
  - The project's testing infrastructure was fully migrated from Vitest to `Bun test`, aligning the plugin with a more Bun-centric toolchain. To improve code robustness, stricter TypeScript rules were implemented, Node.js-specific types were removed, and typechecking was integrated into the build process. As part of this effort, new tests were added for configuration guards, and enhancements were made to SOL swap handling ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/22)).
