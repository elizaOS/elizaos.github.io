# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing the stability and capabilities of the Solana plugin. Key efforts included significant improvements to the Solana service, introducing support for Token-2022 metadata parsing and batch utilities to broaden token standard compatibility. Additionally, a critical fix to the build script resolved import errors and brought the plugin's build process into alignment with other ElizaOS plugins, ensuring greater consistency across the ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on bug fixes and service improvements aimed at increasing the plugin's reliability and feature set.

- **Solana Service and Type Improvements:** To enhance the plugin's ability to interact with a wider range of Solana tokens, significant updates were made to the core Solana service. This included type fixes and the implementation of utilities for parsing Token-2022 metadata, a crucial step for supporting modern token standards on the network ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/16)).

- **Build Script Standardization:** The build process was made more robust by updating the script to use `Bun.build` directly. This change fixed a critical bug caused by a non-existent `build-utils` import and aligned the build process with that of `plugin-openai`, promoting consistency and stability across the ElizaOS plugin ecosystem ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/17)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. Discussion continued on an older, previously stale issue regarding Twitter space functionality ([#4180](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/4180)). The investigation is ongoing, with recent activity focused on clarifying the environment and branch used when encountering a `dyld` error.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in both development and issue triage. The effort to align the build script with `plugin-openai` ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/17)) demonstrates a commitment to maintaining consistency across the broader ElizaOS project. Additionally, community engagement is visible in the ongoing debugging efforts for issue [#4180](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/4180), where contributors are actively working to diagnose the root cause of a complex problem.
