# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on collaborative diagnostics and future-proofing the project, rather than merging new features. The primary focus was a community-driven investigation into a critical import error affecting users of Eliza CLI v1.6.1. This effort successfully identified the root cause within the `@elizaos/core` dependency. In parallel, new pull requests were opened to introduce automated dependency management with Renovate and to add support for Solana's Token 2022 upgrades, setting the stage for future development and improved project maintenance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no new code was merged this week, two significant pull requests were opened, proposing key improvements to the plugin's maintenance and functionality.

-   **Dependency Management Automation**
    A new pull request ([#13](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/13)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration. This aims to automate the process of keeping project dependencies up-to-date, ensuring better security and stability over time.

-   **Solana Token 2022 Support**
    To enhance the plugin's capabilities, a pull request ([#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/14)) was submitted to address upgrades related to Solana's Token 2022 program.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was dominated by the investigation of a single, high-impact bug.

-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.
-   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported. The sole focus was on an active issue:
    -   **Eliza CLI Import Errors ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6031))**: Significant discussion took place regarding `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61`. The investigation, led by contributor `claude`, concluded that the root cause was not in the Solana plugin but in the `@elizaos/core@1.6.1` package, which was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. The recommended solution is for users to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or a later version. It was also suggested that the core team consider yanking the faulty version from npm to prevent further issues.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The collaborative spirit of the community was on full display in the handling of issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6031). There was a high degree of discussion involving multiple contributors, including `matteo-brandolino`, `claude`, `0xbbjoker`, and `wtfsayo`. This teamwork enabled a swift and detailed diagnosis of a complex issue originating in an upstream dependency, demonstrating a healthy and engaged developer community focused on collective problem-solving.
