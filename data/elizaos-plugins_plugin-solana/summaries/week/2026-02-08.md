# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Weekly Report (Feb 8 - 14, 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week, development focused on maturing the Solana plugin's infrastructure through enhanced API resilience and core system refactoring. A major milestone was the implementation of cloud proxy routing for Birdeye and Helius, ensuring high availability for users without direct API keys. The project also saw significant improvements to transaction handling, Token-2022 metadata parsing, and the introduction of a dedicated CA lookup provider. These updates, coupled with comprehensive documentation, strengthen the plugin's position as a robust tool for decentralized AI agents.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### API Resilience & Proxy Routing
To ensure seamless connectivity, the plugin now supports cloud proxy routing for major Solana data providers. This establishes a tiered priority system for API requests: direct user keys are prioritized, followed by the Eliza Cloud proxy, and finally public endpoints.
*   Implemented cloud proxy routing for Birdeye and Helius ([#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/26)).

### Core Transaction & Token Infrastructure
Significant effort was directed toward refactoring the underlying transaction system and improving how the plugin interacts with on-chain token data.
*   **Transaction Refactor:** Overhauled the transaction system and introduced exchange-driven swap execution ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/24)).
*   **Token-2022 Support:** Enhanced metadata parsing for the Token-2022 standard ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/24)).
*   **CA Lookup Provider:** Introduced a new provider to fetch on-chain token details, specifically registered when `spartan-intel` is absent ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/23)).
*   **Network Registration:** Solana networks are now officially registered with `INTEL_CHAIN` ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/24)).

### Documentation and Stability
The project’s accessibility was improved through a major documentation overhaul, providing clear paths for new developers and users.
*   Updated the README with detailed installation guides, environment variable configurations, and usage examples ([#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/11)).
*   Introduced rate limiting and improved CA lookup logic in ongoing feature work ([#27](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/27)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### New & Active Issues
The community is currently focused on expanding the flexibility of the plugin's underlying AI integrations.
*   **Custom OpenAI Endpoints:** Discussion is active on [#6490](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6490) regarding support for custom OpenAI-compatible base URLs. This is viewed as a critical feature for enabling compatibility with third-party services and local testing environments like Arko Studio.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week was characterized by high-impact contributions from core developers, particularly in the areas of infrastructure and documentation. The opening of PR [#27](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/27) indicates a shift toward more complex transaction actions and task-based providers. Community dialogue remains focused on interoperability, as evidenced by the technical discussions surrounding custom endpoint support to allow the plugin to function across a wider variety of LLM providers.
