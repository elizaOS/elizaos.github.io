# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Daily Update (Oct 31, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on foundational improvements, including significant refactoring for multichain and exchange API work, transaction system enhancements, and token2022 improvements. Additionally, efforts were made to enable stricter TypeScript type checking and transition to Bun for testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core System Refactoring and Multichain Enhancements
Significant work was initiated to refactor the transaction system and improve multichain and exchange API functionalities, alongside enhancements for Token2022. This aims to bolster the plugin's interoperability and support for advanced token standards. ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/24))

### Development Environment and Type Safety Improvements
Efforts were made to enable stricter TypeScript type checking during the build process, remove Node.js-specific types, and transition from Vitest to Bun for testing. This will lead to a more robust and efficient development workflow. ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/22))

### Central Authority Lookup Provider Integration
A new pull request was opened to integrate a Central Authority Lookup Provider, specifically for cases where `spartan-intel` is not used. This will enhance the plugin's ability to resolve central authorities. ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/23))
