## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, including improvements to the Solana service and build script, ensuring better stability and consistency for the plugin.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Solana Service and Type Improvements
Significant improvements were made to the Solana service, including type fixes and the addition of Token-2022 metadata parsing and batch utilities. This enhances the plugin's ability to handle various Solana token standards. ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/16))
