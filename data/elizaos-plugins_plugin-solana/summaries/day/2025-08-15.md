# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Daily Update (Aug 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `plugin-solana` with a suite of new utility functions for Solana interactions and refining internal service configurations. Significant progress was also made in resolving critical publishing and testing issues, improving the overall stability and usability of ElizaOS plugins.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Solana Utility Functions
A comprehensive set of new utility functions has been added to streamline interactions with the Solana blockchain. These include tools for address type identification, token account retrieval, balance checking, metadata address resolution, token symbol fetching, address validation, and direct swap execution via `plugin-jupiter`. These additions significantly expand the plugin's capabilities for developers. ([#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/10))

### Service Configuration Refinement
The internal configuration of the plugin has been updated to explicitly set the chain/service and rename the service to `chain_solana`. This change improves clarity and consistency within the ElizaOS framework, though it may require adjustments for existing integrations. ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/8))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Resolution of Plugin Publishing Failures
A critical issue where the `elizaos publish --npm` command reported success but failed to publish plugins to npm has been resolved. The root causes were identified as incorrect scoped package naming and an outdated plugin template. The fix involved updating the package name to be unscoped and ensuring the `package.json` matches the current template structure. ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5754))

### Guidance on Plugin Testing Errors
Guidance was provided for a recurring testing error encountered during plugin development. The resolution involved correctly setting up WebSocket mocks before imports to ensure the service utilizes the mock instead of attempting real connections, along with general advice on mock setup, consistent library usage, and debugging.
