## ACTIVE ISSUES
Discussion continued on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6031), concerning "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61". On October 5th, `matteo-brandolino` suggested the issue might stem from missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing `dist/index.d.ts` and `dist/types/index.d.ts` exporting from a non-existent `src` directory. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolved the problem, indicating a potential bug specific to version 1.6.1.
