## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6031)
The discussion on this issue suggests that the problem might stem from incorrect type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing source files that are not included in the published package. This could explain why TypeScript fails to find imports like `logger`, `Project`, or `IAgentRuntime`. It's hypothesized that this is a bug specific to version 1.6.1 of `@Elizaos/core`, as downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 reportedly resolves the issue. The problem occurs in newly created projects using `elizaos create`, although the project functions correctly when run with `elizaos start`.
