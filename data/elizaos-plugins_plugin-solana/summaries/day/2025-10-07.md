- **Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61** [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6031):
    - Claude provided a detailed root cause analysis, identifying that version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core` was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files, causing exports like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` to be unavailable.
    - Claude recommended users upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later, and suggested the ElizaOS team consider deprecating v1.6.1 and adding publish-time validation.
    - @wtfsayo requested @claude to diagnose the issue.
    - @matteo-brandolino provided their Node, Bun, and OS versions (Node v24.9.0, Bun 1.2.22, x86_64 Arch Linux) as requested by @0xbbjoker.
    - @wtfsayo followed up with @matteo-brandolino to confirm the OS.
