## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Eliza CLI Import Errors Diagnosis [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6031)
Discussion continued on the `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61` issue. A detailed diagnosis by `claude` confirmed that the root cause is specific to `@elizaos/core@1.6.1`, which was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. All reported missing exports are present in the source code but were not properly exposed in the published package's `.d.ts` files. The issue is version-specific and environment-independent. Recommendations include upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later, considering yanking v1.6.1 from npm, and adding publish-time validation. `matteo-brandolino` provided system details (Node v24.9.0, Bun 1.2.22, x86_64 OS) and thanked `0xbbjoker` for assistance. `wtfsayo` inquired if the OS was Windows.
