### Diagnosing `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1 Import Issues [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6031)
Discussion continued regarding the import errors in `index.ts` when using `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1. The user `matteo-brandolino` confirmed the issue persists on Arch Linux, responding to a query about the operating system. This follows a detailed diagnosis by `claude` on October 7th, which identified the root cause as missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1, recommending users upgrade to v1.6.2 or later. The issue is confirmed to be version-specific and environment-independent.
