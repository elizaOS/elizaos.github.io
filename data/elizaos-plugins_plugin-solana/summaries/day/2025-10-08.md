### Investigation into Eliza CLI Import Errors [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6031)
Discussion continued regarding an issue where imports in `index.ts` fail when creating a new project using `elizaos create`. The user `matteo-brandolino` provided their OS as Arch Linux and confirmed that the issue persists with `elizaos create`. The issue appears to be specific to `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, with earlier and later versions reportedly working correctly. The user `matteo-brandolino` suggested that the problem might stem from missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in the published `1.6.1` package, referencing source files that are not included in the installed package. This theory was further supported by `claude`'s detailed diagnosis, which concluded that version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core` was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files, making the issue version-specific and environment-independent. `claude` recommended users upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later and suggested the ElizaOS team consider deprecating v1.6.1.
