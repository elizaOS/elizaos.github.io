# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Daily Update (Oct 26, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on a critical bug fix addressing a race condition in Solana service initialization and a routine version bump.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Solana Service Initialization Fix
A race condition where `SolanaWalletService` failed to initialize due to `SolanaService` not being ready has been resolved. This fix ensures proper lazy loading of `SolanaService` when both services are registered, preventing initialization errors. ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/18))

### Version Update
The project version has been bumped to 1.2.6. This is a chore update with no functional changes. ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/19))
