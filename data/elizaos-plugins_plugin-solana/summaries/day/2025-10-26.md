# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Daily Update (Oct 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a critical bug fix addressing a race condition in the Solana Wallet Service and a routine version bump.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Solana Wallet Service Race Condition Fix
A significant bug was resolved that prevented the `SolanaWalletService` from initializing correctly due to a race condition. The fix involves lazy loading `SolanaService`, ensuring it's available when `SolanaWalletService` attempts to initialize, thereby preventing the "Solana Service is required for Solana Wallet Service" error ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/18)).

### Version Update
The project version was bumped to 1.2.6. This is a chore update with no functional changes ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/19)).
