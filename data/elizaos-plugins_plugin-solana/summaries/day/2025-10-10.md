## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Direct API Calls Discussion**
  Discussions continued on [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5923) regarding the implementation of a `generate` API. The conversation clarified that `generate` would specifically refer to text generation, suggesting a renaming to `generateText` for clarity. A proposal was made for a `generateText(input: string, options?: GenerateTextOptions)` function, with options for including character personality and specifying model type. This approach aims to be future-proof for potential additional return types.
