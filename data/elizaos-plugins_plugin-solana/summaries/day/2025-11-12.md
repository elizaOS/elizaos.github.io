# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Daily Update (Nov 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on enhancing the plugin's testing infrastructure and TypeScript strictness, migrating to Bun-centric testing, and improving SOL swap handling.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing and Type-Checking
Significant work was done to enable typechecks in the build process and implement stricter TypeScript configurations. This included removing Node.js-specific types and transitioning the testing framework from Vitest to Bun test. Configuration guard tests were also added, and the handling of SOL swaps was improved.
