      "body": "<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\n> [!NOTE]\n> **Medium Risk**\n> Touches core Solana RPC/service logic with new background task execution, caching, and retry behavior, which could impact performance, rate limits, and correctness across wallet/tx-related flows.\n> \n> **Overview**\n> Adds **RPC-only transaction history fetching** to `SolanaService`, including signature pagination, batched/concurrent `getParsedTransactions`, cache + checkpoint storage, retry/circuit-breaker logic, and a `FETCH_SOLANA_TRANSACTIONS` task worker with status polling (`getTransactionFetchStatus`/`waitForTransactionFetch`) and optional task chaining.\n> \n> Introduces **transaction signature lookup** via a new `LOOKUP_SOLANA_SIGNATURE` action and `SOLANA_SIGNATURE_LOOKUP` provider, and updates swap/transfer flows to safely handle non-string `SOLANA_RPC_URL` settings.\n> \n> Refactors/extends wallet + CA lookup behavior: wallet provider can answer queries for explicit addresses or the agent\u0019s wallet, `getDecimals` now returns an address-keyed map (provider + tests updated), and RPC calls used in account batching are now rate-limited with backoff. Adds docs/tests for transaction fetching, new `RateLimiter` utility, dependency `p-limit`, and build/tsconfig/.gitignore hygiene changes.\n> \n> <sup>Written by [Cursor Bugbot](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot) for commit 29756afe9ae51074b5b51b21ac5f3ab2965f0583.
