      "body": "## Description\n\nFixes the race condition where `SolanaWalletService` fails to initialize with error \"Solana Service is required for Solana Wallet Service\".\n\n## Problem\n\nWhen both `SolanaService` and `SolanaWalletService` are registered from the same plugin, the wallet service constructor tries to access `chain_solana` via `runtime.getService()` before the service is fully registered and available.\n\n## Solution\n\nChanged `SolanaWalletService` to use lazy initialization via a getter instead of constructor initialization. The `solanaService` is now loaded on first access, ensuring the service is available when needed.\n\n## Changes\n\n- Replaced direct constructor initialization with a private getter\n- Maintains backward compatibility - all existing method calls work unchanged\n- No API changes required\n\n## Testing\n\nVerified that both services now register successfully without errors.\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **Refactor**\n  * Refactored Solana service initialization to use lazy loading for more efficient resource management.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
