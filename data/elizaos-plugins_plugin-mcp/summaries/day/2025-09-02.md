# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Daily Update (Sep 2, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a critical bug fix for logger compatibility and extensive linting across various source files to improve code quality and consistency.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Logger Compatibility Fix
A significant bug affecting logger compatibility was addressed and resolved, ensuring proper logging functionality within the plugin. This fix involved changes across multiple utility and action files.
- Fixed logger compatibility issue ([#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/15))

### Codebase Linting and Quality
Extensive linting was performed across the `src/actions`, `src/utils`, and `src` directories. This effort aimed to standardize code style and improve overall code quality and maintainability.
- Linted `package.json`, `src/actions/callToolAction.ts`, `src/actions/readResourceAction.ts`, `src/service.ts`, `src/utils/error.ts`, `src/utils/handler.ts`, `src/utils/processing.ts`, and `src/utils/wrapper.ts`.

### Refactoring Eliza CLI
Discussions continued on the "Refactor Eliza CLI" issue ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5860)), with a focus on streamlining the CLI and delegating more logic to project directories and the `@eliza/server` package. Key points from today's discussion include:
- **Delegation of Responsibilities:** `standujar` proposed a clear distinction of responsibilities: `@eliza/server` for agent lifecycle, plugin loading, database management, and character loading; `@eliza/cli` for remote control and output; and starter projects for composition roots and minimal bootstrapping.
- **CLI vs. Project Logic:** `wtfsayo` and `odilitime` debated the extent to which logic should move out of the CLI and into projects, with concerns about syncing functions across projects.
- **Progress Update:** `standujar` provided a detailed progress update on the CLI refactor, highlighting the new autonomous starter, CLI delegation, argument passthrough, and restructured project starter. The next steps involve comprehensive testing and migration of project-specific tests.
- **Latest Comments:** `standujar` referenced issue #5864, indicating further related work or discussion. `standujar` also noted "Restarting from clean !", suggesting a fresh approach or re-evaluation of current work.
