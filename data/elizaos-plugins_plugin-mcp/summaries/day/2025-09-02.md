## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Logger Compatibility Fix
- Addressed a critical bug related to logger compatibility, ensuring proper logging functionality within the plugin ([#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/15)).

### Codebase Linting

### Refactoring Eliza CLI
Discussion on [#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5860) continued with a focus on streamlining the Eliza CLI. Key points from the latest comments include:
- **CLI Delegation:** The CLI should primarily handle configuration and delegate execution to project directories, moving away from bootstrapping AgentServer within the CLI itself.
- **Server vs. CLI Responsibilities:** There's an ongoing debate about what responsibilities should reside in the `@eliza/server` package (e.g., Agent lifecycle, plugin loading, database migrations) versus the `@eliza/cli` (remote control, output) and starter projects (composition root, minimal bootstrapping).
- **Project Autonomy:** A proposed architecture suggests projects should own their runtime, with `elizaos start` simply handing off to `bun run start` inside the project.
- **Concerns about Duplication:** There are concerns about avoiding duplication of logic across projects if too much responsibility is shifted out of the CLI and into individual project setups.
- **Progress Update:** A detailed progress update was provided on the CLI refactor, outlining completed phases (architecture & delegation, restructured project starter) and next steps focusing on testing and migration of existing tests.
