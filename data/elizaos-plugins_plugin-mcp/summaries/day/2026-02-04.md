# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Daily Update (Feb 4, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a significant feature addition to the `plugin-mcp` repository, introducing per-user MCP connections with dynamic API key injection. This enhancement improves multi-tenancy and security for MCP interactions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Multi-tenancy and Secure Connections
- Implemented per-user MCP connections, allowing for dynamic API key injection based on individual user contexts. This change significantly improves the isolation and security of multi-tenant environments. ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/23))
- Modified the MCP connection lifecycle and request headers to support these new per-user connections. This is a medium-risk change that requires careful consideration of request context and URL-origin checks to prevent misconfiguration. ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/23))
