### Investigation into `@elizaos/core` Import Errors [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/6031)
Discussion continued on the issue where imports like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` are not found in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61. The latest comment from @matteo-brandolino clarified that the user is on Arch Linux. Previously, @wtfsayo had asked for the user's OS to help diagnose the problem, following a detailed analysis by Claude. Claude's analysis concluded that the root cause is a build/publish pipeline issue specific to `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, where essential TypeScript declaration files were either missing or malformed. Claude recommended users upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later and suggested the ElizaOS team consider deprecating v1.6.1.
