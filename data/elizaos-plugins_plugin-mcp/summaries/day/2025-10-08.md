**Troubleshooting Eliza CLI 1.61 Import Issues**
Discussions continued on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/6031) regarding imports not being found in `index.ts` with Eliza CLI 1.61. @matteo-brandolino provided an update on their OS (Arch Linux) and shared the output of `bun x tsc --noEmit`, which showed numerous `TS2305` errors related to missing exported members from `@elizaos/core`. This output further highlighted the scope of the import problem.
