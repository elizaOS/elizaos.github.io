# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Daily Update (Feb 8, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on enhancing multi-tenant safety within the MCP plugin by eliminating shared-state mutations and implementing lazy HTTP connections.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Multi-Tenant Safety for MCP Connections
A significant bug fix was implemented to address shared-state MCP mutation, ensuring multi-tenant safety. This involved making all HTTP MCP connections lazy after schema fetching, where `ensureConnected()` now creates per-entity connections with correct API keys from the request context. ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/24))
