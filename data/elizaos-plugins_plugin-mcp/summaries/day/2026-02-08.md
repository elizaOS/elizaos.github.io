## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on enhancing the multi-tenant safety of the MCP plugin by eliminating shared-state mutations, ensuring secure and isolated connections for each entity.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Multi-Tenant Safety for MCP Connections
A significant bug fix was implemented to address shared-state MCP mutation, crucial for multi-tenant safety. This involved making all HTTP MCP connections lazy after schema fetching, ensuring that `ensureConnected()` creates per-entity connections with correct API keys from the request context. Additionally, `MCP_ENABLED_SER` was added. ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/24))
