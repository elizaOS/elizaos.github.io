- **Eliza CLI 1.61 Import Errors:** Discussion on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/6031) continued, investigating `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61`. The latest comment from matteo-brandolino suggests the issue might stem from incorrect type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing source files not included in the published package. Downgrading to version 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 reportedly resolves the problem.
