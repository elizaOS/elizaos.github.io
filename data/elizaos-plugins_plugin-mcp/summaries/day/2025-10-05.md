## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Imports Not Found in `index.ts` with Eliza CLI 1.61** ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/6031)): The discussion continued regarding import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61.
    - **User Observation**: @matteo-brandolino suggested the issue might stem from missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing non-existent `src` directories in `dist/index.d.ts` and `dist/types/index.d.ts`. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem.
    - **Troubleshooting Steps**: @0xbbjoker previously suggested running `bun x tsc --noEmit` to diagnose the issue, suspecting a problem with the IDE's TypeScript compiler.
    - **Further Details**: @matteo-brandolino confirmed the issue occurs in a newly created project using `elizaos create` and provided a screenshot illustrating the import errors. They also confirmed that the project functions correctly when run with `elizaos start`, indicating a type-checking specific problem.
