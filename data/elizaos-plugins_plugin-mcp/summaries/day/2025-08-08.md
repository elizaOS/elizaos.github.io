## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Core Build Failure Blocking Testing:** Issue [#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5738) details a build failure in `@elizaos/core` due to TypeScript errors during the DTS build. The latest comment from monilpat confirms the issue was identified during a morning call, exists on the latest branch, and is blocking testing of complex scenarios such as advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading.
- **Eliza CLI Build Failure:** Issue [#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5734) reports that the ElizaOS CLI fails to build projects. The latest comment from wtfsayo suggests that this issue might be fixed in the 1.4.x version. An earlier comment from Kemystra identified the problem as a missing placeholder in `logger.info` calls within `templates/project-starter/src/index.ts` and other template files, providing a fix.
