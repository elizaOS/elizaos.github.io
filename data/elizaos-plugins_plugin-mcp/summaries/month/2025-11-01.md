# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
November's development activity focused on foundational maintenance and improving the clarity of the plugin's core actions. Key work involved renaming primary actions to be more specific to the MCP plugin, ensuring better namespacing and understandability within the broader ElizaOS ecosystem. To maintain stability and leverage the latest framework enhancements, the plugin's core dependency was also updated. These changes, while foundational, are crucial for ensuring long-term integration and compatibility.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
All development this month was consolidated into a single effort aimed at refining the plugin's interface and aligning it with the core system.

- **Action Naming and Dependency Alignment**
  To improve clarity and prevent potential naming conflicts, core actions were renamed. `CALL_TOOL` is now `CALL_MCP_TOOL`, and `READ_RESOURCE` is now `READ_MCP_RESOURCE`. Importantly, backward compatibility was maintained to ensure a smooth transition for existing implementations. This refactoring effort also included updating the `@elizaos/core` dependency to version `^1.5.4`, bringing the plugin in line with the latest core framework improvements ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/18)).
