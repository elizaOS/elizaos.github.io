# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
Development in December focused on foundational enhancements to the Master Control Program (MCP) provider. The key effort involved improving the provider's configuration capabilities and refining how tool responses are integrated into an agent's memory. This work contributes directly to more robust and adaptable agent behavior by ensuring that interactions with tools are more effectively managed and remembered.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on a single, significant update to improve the core functionality of the MCP provider and its interaction with agent memory systems.

- **MCP Provider and Tool Response Handling**
  A new feature was introduced to enhance the MCP provider's configuration with an optional `mcpText` field, allowing for more flexible, formatted setups. In a key refactoring effort, the `handleToolResponse` function was modified to return a `Memory` object instead of a simpler type. This change, supported by updates to the `callTool` function, enables a more seamless integration of tool outputs into the agent's memory, a crucial step for learning and adaptability ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).
