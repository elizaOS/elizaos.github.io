# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development activity centered on improving project maintenance and investigating a critical compatibility issue. A significant step was taken to automate dependency management with the introduction of a Renovate configuration. Concurrently, investigation continued into a notable import error affecting users of Eliza CLI version 1.61, with community input pointing towards a potential root cause in the `@Elizaos/core` package.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on foundational project health rather than new features.

- **Dependency Management Automation:** To streamline maintenance and ensure the project stays current with its dependencies, a pull request ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/17)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration file. This will help automate the process of updating dependencies in the future.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was focused on a single, impactful bug.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed during this period.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. The primary focus was on the active issue **Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/6031))**. Discussion suggests the problem is isolated to Eliza CLI v1.61 and may be caused by incorrect type definition file paths in the `@Elizaos/core` package. Users have found that downgrading to v1.5.15 or upgrading to a version newer than 1.6.1 serves as a temporary workaround.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the troubleshooting process for the month's key issue. The discussion on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/6031) highlighted community involvement, with user `matteo-brandolino` providing a detailed analysis that helped identify the potential root cause of the import errors.
