# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
Activity in September focused on enhancing codebase stability and quality, alongside significant architectural planning for future development. A critical bug impacting logger compatibility was resolved, ensuring reliable functionality across the plugin. This was complemented by an extensive linting effort to enforce code consistency. Meanwhile, a major discussion around refactoring the Eliza CLI ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5860)) signals a strategic push towards a more modular and streamlined architecture, delegating responsibilities between the server, CLI, and project starters.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this period centered on immediate fixes and foundational code improvements.

- **Bug Fixes & Stability**
  A key bug affecting logger compatibility was fixed in pull request [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/15). This resolution addressed an important issue to ensure proper logging behavior within the plugin's actions and utilities.

- **Code Quality & Maintenance**
  A comprehensive linting pass was performed across the codebase to improve code quality and maintainability. This effort standardized formatting and style in core files, including `package.json`, `service.ts`, and various files within the `src/actions` and `src/utils` directories.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed during this period, with the primary focus remaining on a significant active issue.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed.
- **New & Active Issues:** The most significant activity was the ongoing discussion on issue [#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5860), "Refactor Eliza CLI". This discussion involves a major architectural redesign aimed at streamlining the CLI. Key proposals include delegating agent lifecycle and data management to `@eliza/server`, reducing the CLI to a remote control, and using starter projects for composition. The debate continues on how much logic should be moved out of the CLI, with `standujar` providing a detailed progress update on the refactor before noting a "Restarting from clean !", suggesting a re-evaluation of the current approach.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was most visible in the strategic discussion surrounding the Eliza CLI refactor ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5860)). Contributors `standujar`, `wtfsayo`, and `odilitime` engaged in a detailed debate on the future architecture of the project's core components. This highlights a healthy process of community-driven design on foundational aspects of the ElizaOS framework, with `standujar` leading the implementation effort.
