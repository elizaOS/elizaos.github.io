# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
Development in August was characterized by a focus on addressing critical infrastructure issues rather than shipping new features. Progress was significantly hampered by blocking build failures in both `@elizaos/core` and the Eliza CLI, which prevented testing of more complex functionalities. Despite these challenges, collaborative efforts were underway to diagnose the root causes, and a new pull request was opened to improve logger compatibility, signaling a move towards stabilization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features or bug fixes were completed during this period. Development efforts were concentrated on identifying and resolving foundational blockers.

- **Logger Compatibility**
  - Work began to address system stability with the opening of a pull request to fix logger compatibility ([#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/15)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project's issue landscape was dominated by active, high-priority blockers. No issues were closed or newly created during this timeframe.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - No issues were reported as closed in August.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - The team's focus was on two critical, active issues that have stalled further development and testing:
    - **`@elizaos/core` Build Failure ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5738)):** A TypeScript error during the DTS build is blocking testing for advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading.
    - **Eliza CLI Build Failure ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5734)):** The CLI is unable to build projects. A potential cause has been identified related to a missing placeholder in `logger.info` calls within project templates.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was centered on diagnosing the critical build failures. Discussions on issue [#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5738) during a team call confirmed the problem's existence on the latest branch. For the CLI issue ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5734)), contributors actively investigated and provided potential fixes, demonstrating a focused, collaborative effort to resolve these foundational blockers.
