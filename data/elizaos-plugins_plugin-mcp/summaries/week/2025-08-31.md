# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing codebase stability and engaging in strategic architectural planning. A critical bug affecting logger compatibility was resolved, ensuring reliable functionality within the plugin. Alongside this fix, a comprehensive linting pass was completed across core files to uphold code quality standards. Concurrently, significant discussion continued on the refactoring of the Eliza CLI, focusing on defining clear responsibilities between the CLI, server, and individual projects to promote greater modularity and autonomy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on immediate bug fixes and broad code quality improvements.

- **Logger Compatibility Fix**
  - A critical bug impacting logger functionality was addressed, restoring proper logging within the plugin. This fix was merged in PR [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/15).

- **Code Quality and Maintenance**
  - To maintain code consistency and quality, extensive linting was performed across the codebase. Affected files include `package.json` and numerous source files in `src/actions/`, `src/utils/`, and the root `src/service.ts`.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed this week, with the primary focus remaining on a significant active discussion.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No new issues were reported.
  - Discussion on active issue [#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5860) regarding the **Eliza CLI refactor** was a major point of focus. The conversation centered on architectural direction, with key proposals including:
    - The CLI should delegate execution to project directories rather than bootstrapping the AgentServer itself.
    - A clearer separation of concerns is being debated for `@eliza/server` (agent lifecycle, plugin loading), `@eliza/cli` (remote control), and starter projects (composition root).
    - A progress update was shared, indicating the initial architecture and project starter restructuring phases are complete, with work now moving toward testing.
