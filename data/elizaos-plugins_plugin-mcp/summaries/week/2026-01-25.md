# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Weekly Report (Jan 25 - 31, 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week, development for the `plugin-mcp` focused on advancing the project's core networking capabilities to support more robust and flexible communication protocols. The primary achievement was the introduction of a new transport layer designed to handle streaming data and authenticated requests. These improvements align with the ElizaOS mission of modularity and adaptability, ensuring that agents can interact with a wider array of external services through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## 🛠️️ Key Developments

### Enhanced Network Transport & Connectivity
The focus of technical work this week centered on expanding how the plugin handles HTTP-based communication. By moving toward more sophisticated transport methods, the framework increases its utility in complex, real-time environments.

*   **StreamableHTTP Implementation:** Work began on implementing a `StreamableHTTP` transport layer. This is designed to facilitate more efficient data handling for long-running connections or large data transfers between the agent and MCP servers.
*   **Custom Header Support:** To improve compatibility with secured environments and third-party APIs, support for custom headers in HTTP connections was introduced. This allows for better authentication handling and metadata transmission during the handshake and request phases.
*   **Key Pull Request:** [#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/20) - Implements StreamableHTTP transport and custom headers for HTTP connections.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Based on the provided data for this period, the focus remained on the active development of the transport layer. No new issues were reported as opened or closed during this specific window, suggesting a concentrated effort on the primary pull request currently under review.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was centered on the architectural refinement of the plugin's communication stack. The opening of PR [#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/20) represents a significant contribution to the project's networking foundation. The activity indicates a move toward supporting more professional-grade infrastructure requirements, such as those requiring specific headers for security and streaming for performance.
