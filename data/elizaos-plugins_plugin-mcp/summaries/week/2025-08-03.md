# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Weekly Report (Aug 3 - 9, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development was characterized by a focus on critical bug investigation rather than new feature delivery. Progress was largely blocked by two significant build failures originating in `@elizaos/core` and the Eliza CLI project templates. While no work was completed, a new pull request was opened to address logger compatibility, and community members actively collaborated on diagnosing the root causes of the blocking build issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the available data, no pull requests were merged or work completed this week. Development efforts were instead directed toward addressing foundational issues.

A new pull request, [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/15), was opened to fix a logger compatibility issue, representing the only new code contribution initiated during this period.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project's focus was heavily on issue triage, with no issues being closed. The primary activity centered on two critical, active issues that are currently blocking further development and testing.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **`@elizaos/core` Build Failure:** Issue [#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5738) remains a major blocker. The build is failing due to TypeScript errors, which prevents testing of complex scenarios like advanced mocking and dynamic plugin loading.
    - **Eliza CLI Project Build Failure:** Issue [#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5734) details a failure when building a new project with the CLI. Investigation revealed the cause to be a missing placeholder in `logger.info` calls within project templates.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Despite the development blockers, there was active collaboration around troubleshooting. Contributors `monilpat`, `wtfsayo`, and `Kemystra` were engaged in the active issues. Notably, `Kemystra` identified the specific cause of the CLI build failure ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5734)), while `monilpat` confirmed the `@elizaos/core` build failure ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5738)) after a team call, demonstrating focused community effort on resolving these critical problems.
