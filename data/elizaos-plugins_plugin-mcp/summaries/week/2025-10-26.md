# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development focused on maintenance and improving the clarity of the plugin's API. Key actions were renamed to be more specific to the MCP plugin, a change designed to prevent naming conflicts and improve developer experience. Importantly, these changes were implemented with backward compatibility to ensure a seamless transition for existing integrations. The project's core dependency was also updated.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on refining the plugin's public interface and ensuring its stability.

- **Action Naming and Dependency Updates:** To improve clarity and avoid potential conflicts with other plugins, two core actions were renamed. `CALL_TOOL` is now `CALL_MCP_TOOL`, and `READ_RESOURCE` is now `READ_MCP_RESOURCE`. These changes, introduced in PR [#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/18), include provisions for backward compatibility. The same pull request also updated the `@elizaos/core` dependency to version `^1.5.4`.
