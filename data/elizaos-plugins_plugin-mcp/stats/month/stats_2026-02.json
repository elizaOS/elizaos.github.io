      "author": "0xbbjoker",
      "number": 24,
      "body": "## Summary\n- Make all HTTP MCP connections lazy after schema fetch (connect → fetch schemas → disconnect → register lazy). `ensureConnected()` creates per-entity connections with correct API keys from request context.\n- Add `MCP_ENABLED_SERVERS` check in `validate()` via `runtime.getSetting()` for per-user OAuth tool filtering. Fail-open when unset for CLI/non-cloud compatibility.\n- Remove all `as any` casts; add `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` to transport union type.\n- Make `getRequestContext` import optional with info/warn logging when unavailable (not in all `@elizaos/core` versions).\n\n## Context\nIn the multi-tenant cloud environment, a shared `AgentRuntime` is cached per `agentId:orgId`. Previously, HTTP MCP connections were established at init with the first user's API key baked in, and `validate()` returned `true` for all lazy connections regardless of the user's OAuth connections. This allowed User B to invoke MCP tools using User A's OAuth tokens.\n\n## Changes\n- `src/service.ts` — HTTP connections now lazy after schema fetch; optional `getRequestContext` import with logging\n- `src/actions/dynamic-tool-actions.ts` — `validate()` checks `MCP_ENABLED_SERVERS` from request context\n- `src/types.ts` — `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` added to `McpConnection.transport` union\n- `tests/dynamic-tool-actions.test.ts` — 3 new tests for MCP_ENABLED_SERVERS filtering (include, exclude, unset)\n\n## Test plan\n- [x] 207 tests pass, 0 fail\n- [x] Pre-existing TS errors unchanged (6, all in untouched files)\n- [x] Biome clean on all changed files\n- [ ] Verify in cloud environment that User A's OAuth tools are not accessible to User B\n- [ ] Verify CLI/standalone usage unaffected (MCP_ENABLED_SERVERS unset → all tools available)\n\n## Companion PR\n- eliza-cloud-v2: elizaOS/eliza-cloud-v2#315 (cross-instance cache invalidation + request context wiring)\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\n---\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **Medium Risk**\n> Touches core MCP connection lifecycle and action validation logic; mistakes could cause connection churn or incorrectly deny/allow tool access in multi-tenant deployments.\n> \n> **Overview**\n> **Fixes a multi-tenant MCP isolation issue** by changing HTTP server initialization to connect only long enough to fetch schemas, then disconnect and mark the server as lazy so real tool/resource usage reconnects per request/entity with the correct credentials.\n> \n> Adds per-user OAuth gating via new `checkMcpOAuthAccess()` (driven by request-context `MCP_ENABLED_SERVERS`) and wires it into dynamic tool action `validate()` and `READ_MCP_RESOURCE` validation, with fail-open behavior when the setting is absent. Also hardens `McpService` with an optional `getRequestContext` dynamic import, per-connection locking to avoid duplicate connects, and transport typing updates (adds `StreamableHTTPClientTransport`), plus accompanying unit tests for the new access checks.\n> \n> <sup>Written by [Cursor Bugbot](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot) for commit 868a2606ea08f6370bf21e0be745c5a23d8a6c2c.

It moves `@elizaos/core` to peerDependencies to ensure request context is shared, and implements dynamic API key injection from context into HTTP headers.\n\n**Key Changes:**\n- Per-user connection isolation: Connection keys now include entityId for HTTP/SSE transports (e.g., `serverName:entityId`)\n- Dynamic API key injection: Reads `ELIZAOS_API_KEY` from request context and injects into `X-API-Key` header for same-origin requests\n- Peer dependency change: Moved `@elizaos/core` to peerDependencies to share singleton request context\n\n**Critical Issues Found:**\n- Connection key logic fails for eagerly-connected servers: `getConnectionKey()` only checks `lazyConnections` to determine transport type, so eagerly-connected HTTP servers won't get per-user isolation\n- `restartConnection` bug: Uses `getConnectionKey()` to get user-specific key but connection may exist under base key, causing disconnect/reconnect to target wrong connection\n- Environment variable fallback risk: Origin check defaults to `http://localhost:3000` if env vars aren't set, which could cause issues in production\n\n<h3>Confidence Score: 2/5</h3>\n\n- This PR has critical logic bugs that will break connection management in production multi-tenant deployments\n- The per-user isolation feature is well-intentioned but has multiple implementation bugs: getConnectionKey() fails for eagerly-connected HTTP servers, restartConnection() targets wrong connection keys, and environment variable handling is fragile. These issues will cause connection leaks and incorrect routing in production.\n- src/service.ts requires immediate attention to fix connection key management logic\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| package.json | Version bump to 1.8.2 and moved `@elizaos/core` to peerDependencies to share request context |\n| src/service.ts | Implements per-user MCP connections with dynamic API key injection; contains critical bugs in connection key management |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant UserA\n    participant UserB\n    participant McpService\n    participant Context\n    participant Server\n    \n    Note over McpService: Initialization\n    McpService->>McpService: init() creates base connections\n    McpService->>Server: connect(baseName)\n    \n    Note over UserA,Server: First User Request\n    UserA->>Context: Set entity context\n    UserA->>McpService: callTool(serverName)\n    McpService->>McpService: ensureConnected(serverName)\n    McpService->>Context: getRequestContext()\n    Context-->>McpService: entity context returned\n    McpService->>McpService: getConnectionKey(serverName)<br/>returns user-specific key\n    McpService->>McpService: Check connection map\n    Note over McpService: No user-specific connection<br/>exists, create new one\n    McpService->>McpService: Inject headers from context\n    McpService->>Server: New connection with headers\n    McpService->>Server: Execute tool\n    \n    Note over UserB,Server: Second User Request\n    UserB->>Context: Set different entity context\n    UserB->>McpService: callTool(serverName)\n    McpService->>McpService: ensureConnected(serverName)\n    McpService->>Context: getRequestContext()\n    Context-->>McpService: different entity returned\n    McpService->>McpService: getConnectionKey(serverName)<br/>returns different key\n    McpService->>McpService: Check connection map\n    Note over McpService: Separate connection created<br/>per entity\n    McpService->>Server: New connection with<br/>different headers\n    McpService->>Server: Execute tool\n```\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
