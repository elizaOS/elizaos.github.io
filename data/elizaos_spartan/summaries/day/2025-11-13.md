### Spartan News Service Functionality
Discussion continues on issue [#37](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/37), where a user reported that the Spartan News service only posts an initial burst of 2-5 posts before stopping, with occasional later posts. The latest comment from rferrari indicates that the service is currently "working, at least for now" after setting it up using the instructions from the README file.
