## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Billing Page & Stripe Integration ([#6123](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6123))
The CodeRabbit AI has provided a detailed plan for implementing a comprehensive Stripe-backed billing subsystem. This includes creating four new database tables (`customers`, `payment_methods`, `invoices`, `transactions`), adding six backend routers for various billing operations, and developing a TypeScript API client with CRUD types. On the frontend, seven new components will be added for the billing page, covering overview, top-ups, payment methods, invoices, and transaction history. The plan also specifies the inclusion of Stripe environment keys, database migrations, and a `docs/BILLING.md` file. The overall goal is to enable a `/billing` route with full Stripe-based billing and payment support.

### Container Billing Logic ([#6124](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6124))
CodeRabbit AI has outlined a plan to implement a complete container billing system. This involves adding a new database schema (`packages/plugin-sql/src/schema/billing.ts`), a `BillingService` (`packages/server/src/services/billing.ts`), and billing-related types (`packages/server/src/types/billing.ts`). REST API endpoints will be added under `packages/server/src/api/billing/index.ts`. The plan also includes documentation (`BILLING_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, `BILLING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`), and wiring the new schema and routes into the server. The system will feature hourly cron billing, configurable monthly charges, payment failure handling with a 7-day grace period, email notifications, and automatic container deletion.

### Analytics ([#6125](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6125))
The CodeRabbit AI proposes implementing a new analytics API by creating `packages/server/src/api/agents/analytics.ts`. This file will contain three endpoints: `GET /api/agents/:agentId/analytics`, `/models`, and `/services`. These endpoints will support time-range, limit, and type filters, and will aggregate metrics for models, services, containers, chat, and media. Documentation for the analytics API will be added in `packages/server/src/api/agents/ANALYTICS_README.md`, and the analytics router will be mounted in `packages/server/src/api/agents/index.ts`.

### Authentication & Login System ([#6126](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6126))
CodeRabbit AI has provided a plan for a production-ready OAuth and JWT authentication system. This includes adding TypeScript types (`packages/server/src/types/auth.ts`), OAuth configuration (`packages/server/src/config/oauth.ts`), and JWT utilities (`packages/server/src/utils/jwt.ts`). An `AuthService` (`packages/server/src/services/auth.ts`) will be created, along with a database migration (`packages/server/src/migrations/001_auth_tables.sql`). Comprehensive documentation will be provided in `docs/AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` and `docs/AUTH_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md`. The plan also covers wiring routes, middleware, and a new frontend login UI (`packages/client/src/routes/login.tsx`).

### Eliza Chat ([#6127](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6127))
The CodeRabbit AI has outlined a plan to enhance Eliza chat performance. This involves adding a `ModelPerformanceMonitor` with per-model timeouts and exponential-retry wrappers (`packages/core/src/services/model-performance.ts`). Integration of fast providers like Groq and Kimi will be supported, along with setup scripts (`scripts/setup-fast-models.sh`). Real-time logging and metrics will be enabled. Documentation will be updated and added in `docs/MODEL_CONFIGURATION.md`, `docs/CHAT_PERFORMANCE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `docs/README.md`, and `PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`. The `.env.example` file will also be updated with new configuration settings.

### Docs ([#6128](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6128))
CodeRabbit AI has proposed adding a new public documentation route at `/docs`. This will involve creating and wiring `packages/client/src/routes/docs.tsx` to `App.tsx`. The new Docs page will feature three tabs: Architecture Overview, API Explorer, and Character Setup. It will be built using `shadcn/ui` and Tailwind CSS, supporting dark mode, responsive layout, interactive API exploration, code examples, copy-to-clipboard functionality, and toast feedback. Supporting markdown documentation (`packages/client/DOCS_PAGE.md` and `DOCS_PAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`) will also be added.

### Plugin-Cloud Testing ([#6129](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6129))
The CodeRabbit AI has provided a plan to add four new test files under `packages/cli/tests`: `commands/deploy.test.ts`, `commands/containers.test.ts`, `commands/login.test.ts`, and `integration/cloud-documentation.test.ts`. These tests will provide comprehensive coverage and verification for ElizaOS cloud CLI commands (deploy, containers, login), ensuring documentation accuracy, TypeScript option/type consistency, and error-handling scenarios. The tests will be runnable via the existing Bun test runner.
