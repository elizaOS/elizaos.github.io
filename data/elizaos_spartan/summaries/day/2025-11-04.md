## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Billing Page & Stripe Integration** ([#6123](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6123)): CodeRabbit has provided a detailed plan for implementing a complete Stripe-backed billing subsystem. This includes creating four new database tables (`customers`, `payment_methods`, `invoices`, `transactions`), adding six backend routers for various billing operations, developing a TypeScript API client, and creating seven frontend components for the billing page. The plan also covers integrating Stripe environment keys, migrations, and documentation.
- **Container Billing Logic** ([#6124](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6124)): CodeRabbit has outlined a plan to implement a full automated monthly container billing system. This involves adding a new database schema for billing, a `BillingService` with cron job functionality, billing types and cost calculation, REST API endpoints, and comprehensive documentation. The system will handle hourly cron billing, configurable monthly charges, payment failure (pausing containers and a 7-day grace period), email notifications, and automatic container deletion.
- **Analytics** ([#6125](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6125)): CodeRabbit has proposed implementing a new analytics API. This will involve creating `packages/server/src/api/agents/analytics.ts` with three endpoints (`/api/agents/:agentId/analytics`, `/models`, `/services`) to aggregate model, service, container, chat, and media metrics. The plan also includes adding documentation (`packages/server/src/api/agents/ANALYTICS_README.md`) and modifying `packages/server/src/api/agents/index.ts` to mount the new analytics router.
- **Authentication & Login System** ([#6126](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6126)): CodeRabbit has provided a plan to implement a production-ready OAuth and JWT authentication system. This includes adding TypeScript types, OAuth configuration, JWT utilities, an authentication service, and a database migration for auth tables. Comprehensive documentation will be created, and existing files will be modified to integrate new routes, middleware, and a frontend login UI.
- **Eliza Chat** ([#6127](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6127)): CodeRabbit has outlined a plan to enhance Eliza chat responsiveness. This involves adding a `ModelPerformanceMonitor` with per-model timeouts and exponential-retry wrappers, integrating fast providers like Groq and Kimi, enabling real-time logging and metrics, and updating documentation related to model configuration and chat performance troubleshooting.
- **Docs** ([#6128](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6128)): CodeRabbit has proposed adding a new public documentation route at `/docs`. This will involve creating `packages/client/src/routes/docs.tsx` to implement a three-tab documentation page (Architecture Overview, API Explorer, Character Setup) using shadcn/ui and Tailwind. The page will feature a responsive layout, interactive API explorer, code examples, and copy-to-clipboard functionality.
- **Plugin-Cloud Testing** ([#6129](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6129)): CodeRabbit has provided a plan to add four new test files under `packages/cli/tests` to cover `deploy`, `containers`, and `login` commands, as well as integration tests for cloud documentation. These tests will verify CLI command options, data structures, error handling, authentication flows, and documentation consistency.
- **Voice Infrastructure** ([#6130](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6130)): CodeRabbit has outlined a plan to deliver a complete voice infrastructure. This includes adding client-side browser TTS, server-side premium and embeddings endpoints, and comprehensive documentation. Existing files will be modified to integrate premium routing and types, with a focus on requiring `ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN` and provider API keys.
- **Support Tasks** ([#6131](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/6131)): CodeRabbit has created an architecture document (`docs/architecture/anonymous-free-inference.md`) detailing the implementation of an Anonymous ID + Free Inference feature. This involves adding database tables for anonymous users, inference quotas, and usage, introducing a `QuotaService`, integrating user identification and quota enforcement middleware, and updating APIs and frontend for fingerprinting and anonymous sessions.
