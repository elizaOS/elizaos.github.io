## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development was characterized by a focused effort on enhancing the project's plugin architecture. The most significant achievement was a major refactoring of the `degenIntel` plugin, which involved a comprehensive reorganization of its API routes.

Meanwhile, community discussion continued around an active issue concerning the Spartan News Service's reliability.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on a single, impactful pull request aimed at improving a core plugin.

  A substantial restructuring of the `degenIntel` plugin's API was completed to improve its organization and functionality. This effort, captured in PR [#23](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/23), introduced a payment protection layer across various endpoints and added new analytics endpoints specifically for market data. This refactor enhances both the security and the feature set of the plugin.
