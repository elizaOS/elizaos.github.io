However, the changes are extensive (53 files, 1395 additions, 813 deletions) and touch critical trading/wallet logic. The compatibility layer needs runtime validation across both old and new core versions to ensure the fallbacks work correctly.\n- Pay close attention to `src/core-compat.ts`, `src/plugins/degenIntel/services/srv_dataprovider.ts`, `src/plugins/trading/strategies/strategy_llm.ts`, and wallet action files during testing to ensure the compatibility layer works across core versions and position sync logic functions correctly\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| src/core-compat.ts | New compatibility layer for handling different `@elizaos/core` versions with graceful fallbacks |\n| src/types.ts | New file defining `HandlerOptions` type for cross-version compatibility |\n| src/init.ts | Updated to use core-compat helpers and pino-style logging |\n| src/plugins/degenIntel/services/srv_dataprovider.ts | Major refactor: uses core-compat, adds position validation logic, improves wallet filtering |\n| src/plugins/multiwallet/actions/act_wallet_swap.ts | Merge resolution: improved error handling, pino logging, notifyWalletWrite integration |\n| src/plugins/multiwallet/actions/act_wallet_swap_all.ts | Merge resolution: refactored swap logic, batch sending, notifyWalletWrite integration |\n| src/plugins/multiwallet/actions/act_wallet_xfer.ts | Merge resolution: callback-based error handling, notifyWalletWrite integration, cleaner error messages |\n| src/plugins/multiwallet/actions/act_wallet_assess_positions.ts | New action to manually trigger position sync/assessment per wallet |\n| src/plugins/trading/strategies/strategy_llm.ts | Major refactor: portfolio tracking, position filtering by SOL balance, notifyWalletWrite integration |\n| src/tasks/tsk_discord_post.ts | Updated to use `generateObject` from core-compat with proper typing |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Flowchart</h3>\n\n```mermaid\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral'}}%%\nflowchart TD\n    A[PR: Staging Fixes & Core-Compat] --> B[Core Compatibility Layer]\n    A --> C[Service Name Standardization]\n    A --> D[Merge Conflict Resolutions]\n    A --> E[Build & Type Fixes]\n    \n    B --> B1[core-compat.ts]\n    B1 --> B2[getInitPromise]\n    B1 --> B3[getServiceLoadPromise]\n    B1 --> B4[generateObject with hasGenerateObject]\n    B1 --> B5[setCache with optional TTL]\n    B1 --> B6[logCompatError/logCompatDebug]\n    \n    C --> C1[TRADER_DATAPROVIDER → INTEL_DATAPROVIDER]\n    C --> C2[TRADER_CHAIN → INTEL_CHAIN]\n    C --> C3[Service registration alignment]\n    \n    D --> D1[act_wallet_swap]\n    D --> D2[act_wallet_swap_all]\n    D --> D3[act_wallet_xfer]\n    D --> D4[strategy_llm]\n    D1 --> D5[notifyWalletWrite integration]\n    D2 --> D5\n    D3 --> D5\n    D4 --> D5\n    \n    E --> E1[HandlerOptions in types.ts]\n    E --> E2[Pino-style logging throughout]\n    E --> E3[TypeScript type fixes]\n    E --> E4[tsk_discord_post generateObject types]\n    \n    D5 --> F[Position Sync Enhancement]\n    F --> F1[ensurePositionsMatchWalletHoldings]\n    F --> F2[act_wallet_assess_positions action]\n    F --> F3[Prevent stale position data]\n```\n\n<sub>Last reviewed commit: c24e30c</sub>\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **New Features**\n  * Added wallet position assessment action for tracking and updating positions across registered wallets.\n  * Enhanced swap and transfer operations with improved balance calculations, ATA management, and clearer user-facing error messages.\n  * Integrated position synchronization notifications after wallet transactions.\n\n* **Improvements**\n  * Refined portfolio context in trading strategies with SOL balance filtering and price divergence handling.\n  * Added wallet reserve logic to protect liquidity for position exits.\n  * Improved error handling with structured logging across all services.\n  * Enhanced service integration with version compatibility support.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
