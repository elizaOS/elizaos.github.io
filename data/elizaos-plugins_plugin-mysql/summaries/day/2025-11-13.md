### Plugin Functionality and Setup Challenges
Discussion on issue [#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/37) continues regarding difficulties in getting the plugin to work correctly. A user reported that following the `readme` instructions allowed them to set up the plugin successfully, at least for now. The initial problem described was an intermittent posting behavior, where the plugin would post 2-5 times and then stop, or post much later.
