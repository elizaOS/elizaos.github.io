      "number": 16,
      "repository": "elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge",
      "body": "### Version\n1.0.3\n\n### Description\n`processKnowledgeAction` uses the following to generate an unique uuid for new memories:\n`clientDocumentId: createUniqueUuid(runtime.agentId + \"text\" + Date.now(), \"user-knowledge\"),`\n\nHowever, createUniqueUuid does the following:\n```\nexport const createUniqueUuid = (runtime, baseUserId: UUID | string): UUID => {\n  // If the base user ID is the agent ID, return it directly\n  if (baseUserId === runtime.agentId) {\n    return runtime.agentId;\n  }\n\n  // Use a deterministic approach to generate a new UUID based on both IDs\n  // This creates a unique ID for each user+agent combination while still being deterministic\n  const combinedString = `${baseUserId}:${runtime.agentId}`;\n\n  // Create a namespace UUID (version 5) from the combined string\n  return stringToUuid(combinedString);\n};\n```\n\nMeaning that `createUniqueUuid` will always return: `stringToUuid(\"user-knowledge:undefined\")` ie: `4e394ea6-af35-0010-8047-94bccb8b8e5b`\n\n### Expected Result\nThe generated ID should be unique, the easiest approach would be to us `stringToUuid` directly.\n\nIf possible, I would love to contribute. I can fix this issue, and others I've discovered.\n\nThanks,",

      "number": 17,
      "body": "# Relates to\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/16\r\n\r\nThis most likely went unnoticed for three reasons:\r\n1. Eliza still responds postively even if the memory is not stored as 'knowledge'.\r\n2. Because the last few messages are in the context window, both the request to store the memory and the positive response from Eliza are in subsequent queries.\r\n3. The browser client correctly calls `createUniqueUuid` with the agent runtime. \r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n**Low Risk** - Instead of using `createUniqueUuid`, we are using `stringToUuid` in two different places\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n## What does this PR fix?\r\nThe way we generate unique ids for memories, specifically in `actions.ts`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// for documents\r\nclientDocumentId: createUniqueUuid(runtime.agentId + fileName + Date.now(), fileName),\r\n// ...\r\n// for text\r\nclientDocumentId: createUniqueUuid(runtime.agentId + \"text\" + Date.now(), \"user-knowledge\"),\r\n```\r\n\r\nis not unique at all. for text, the result is always `4e394ea6-af35-0010-8047-94bccb8b8e5b` since `createUniqueUuid(runtime.agentId + \"text\" + Date.now(), \"user-knowledge\")` always results in `stringToUuid(\"user-knowledge:undefined\")`. \r\n\r\nFor documents, the result is `stringToUuid(fileName)` which is only unique if the file name is unique.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Fix\r\nTo maintain the initial intent of the code, we should use `stringToUuid` for both text and documents using the existing seeds: `runtime.agentId + fileName + Date.now()` and `runtime.agentId + \"text\" + Date.now() + \"user-knowledge\"`.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Two new tests were added to `__tests__/action.test.ts` to ensure that the unique ids are generated correctly.\r\n2. Existings tests were updated to Mock `Date.now()` to generate predictable ids. \r\n3. To truly verify knowledge is being stored, the \"memories\" table needs to be checked. \r\n\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n- **Tests**\n\t- Enhanced tests to ensure that document IDs are uniquely and deterministically generated based on file content, text, and timestamps.\n\t- Added new tests to verify uniqueness and time-sensitivity of document IDs in different scenarios.\n\n- **Refactor**\n\t- Updated the method for generating document IDs to improve consistency and reliability. No changes to user-facing features or public APIs.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
