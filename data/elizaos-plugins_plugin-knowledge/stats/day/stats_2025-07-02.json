Service doesn't not take runtime.getSettings into account at all.\n\nI also blame how service cstr takes config as a 2nd param. I don't think this system/patterns has been thought through or used properly.\n\nAfter reviewing how/where plugin-twitter does it's config, I believe the service should do the detection and store the configuration",
