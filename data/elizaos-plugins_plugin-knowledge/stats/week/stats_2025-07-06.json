The most significant changes include upgrading dependencies in `package.json`, adding type annotations for runtime parameters, and replacing `runtime.logger` with a direct `logger` import for cleaner logging.\r\n\r\n### Dependency Updates:\r\n* [`package.json`](diffhunk://#diff-7ae45ad102eab3b6d7e7896acd08c427a9b25b346470d7bc6507b6481575d519L36-R65): Upgraded several dependencies, including `react` and `react-dom` to version `^19.1.0`, `zod` to version `4.0.3`, and `dotenv` to version `^17.2.0`. These updates enhance compatibility and functionality.\r\n\r\n### Type Safety Improvements:\r\n* [`src/config.ts`](diffhunk://#diff-c3095d5010e65c52737a98a5d618ea24049ebe90c8470752426081d70ed6e012L16-R16): Updated `validateModelConfig` to accept an optional `runtime` parameter and fixed the default value for `CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED` to `'false'` for consistency.
