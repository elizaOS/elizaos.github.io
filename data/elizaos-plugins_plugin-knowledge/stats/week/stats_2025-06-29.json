      "author": "lkoczorowski",
      "number": 16,
      "repository": "elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge",
      "body": "### Version\n1.0.3\n\n### Description\n`processKnowledgeAction` uses the following to generate an unique uuid for new memories:\n`clientDocumentId: createUniqueUuid(runtime.agentId + \"text\" + Date.now(), \"user-knowledge\"),`\n\nHowever, createUniqueUuid does the following:\n```\nexport const createUniqueUuid = (runtime, baseUserId: UUID | string): UUID => {\n  // If the base user ID is the agent ID, return it directly\n  if (baseUserId === runtime.agentId) {\n    return runtime.agentId;\n  }\n\n  // Use a deterministic approach to generate a new UUID based on both IDs\n  // This creates a unique ID for each user+agent combination while still being deterministic\n  const combinedString = `${baseUserId}:${runtime.agentId}`;\n\n  // Create a namespace UUID (version 5) from the combined string\n  return stringToUuid(combinedString);\n};\n```\n\nMeaning that `createUniqueUuid` will always return: `stringToUuid(\"user-knowledge:undefined\")` ie: `4e394ea6-af35-0010-8047-94bccb8b8e5b`\n\n### Expected Result\nThe generated ID should be unique, the easiest approach would be to us `stringToUuid` directly.\n\nIf possible, I would love to contribute. I can fix this issue, and others I've discovered.\n\nThanks,",
