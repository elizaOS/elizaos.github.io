Process documents from the `knowledge` array in the character configuration\n2. Generate contextualized chunks without errors\n3. Create document fragments in the knowledge base\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\n- Knowledge service fails to process any document chunks\n- All chunks (2/2 in this case) fail processing\n- Document processing completes with 0 fragments created\n- System logs show: `Failed to process 2 chunks out of 2 for document`\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe error appears to be related to:\n\n1. **Invalid Message Format**: The knowledge plugin is constructing prompts with:\n   - `role: \"system\"` (should be \"user\", \"assistant\", or \"tool\")\n   - `content` as an array instead of a string\n   \n2. **AI SDK Compatibility**: The prompt format doesn't match the expected `CoreMessage` or `UIMessage` schema\n\n3. **Version Mismatch**: Potential incompatibility between `@elizaos/plugin-knowledge@1.0.7` and the current AI SDK version\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n1. **Update Knowledge Plugin**: Check if a newer version of `@elizaos/plugin-knowledge` is available that's compatible with the current AI SDK\n2. **Fix Prompt Construction**: Update the knowledge plugin to construct prompts in the correct format\n3. **Add Validation**: Implement proper validation of prompt structure before passing to AI SDK\n\n## Workaround\n\nCurrently, setting `CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=false` allows the system to start normally, but without knowledge processing capabilities.\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThis error occurs during the document contextualization phase where the knowledge service attempts to generate enriched chunks using AI models. The error suggests that the prompt being passed to the `generateText` function doesn't conform to the expected message schema.\n\nThe specific validation errors indicate:\n- Content should be a string, not an array\n- Role should be \"user\", \"assistant\", or \"tool\", not \"system\"\n- Missing required fields for tool messages\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create a character configuration with `@elizaos/plugin-knowledge` in plugins array\n2. Add knowledge documents to the character configuration\n3. Set `CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true` in environment\n4. Start the ElizaOS agent (LOG_LEVEL=debug elizaos start --character test.json )\n5. Observe the error during document processing\n\n## Related Issues\n\nThis appears to be related to the AI SDK prompt validation changes mentioned in:\n- [Vercel AI SDK Discussion #5833](https://github.com/vercel/ai/discussions/5833)\n- AI SDK error documentation for `AI_InvalidPromptError`",

      "author": "lkoczorowski",
      "number": 16,
      "repository": "elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge",
      "body": "### Version\n1.0.3\n\n### Description\n`processKnowledgeAction` uses the following to generate an unique uuid for new memories:\n`clientDocumentId: createUniqueUuid(runtime.agentId + \"text\" + Date.now(), \"user-knowledge\"),`\n\nHowever, createUniqueUuid does the following:\n```\nexport const createUniqueUuid = (runtime, baseUserId: UUID | string): UUID => {\n  // If the base user ID is the agent ID, return it directly\n  if (baseUserId === runtime.agentId) {\n    return runtime.agentId;\n  }\n\n  // Use a deterministic approach to generate a new UUID based on both IDs\n  // This creates a unique ID for each user+agent combination while still being deterministic\n  const combinedString = `${baseUserId}:${runtime.agentId}`;\n\n  // Create a namespace UUID (version 5) from the combined string\n  return stringToUuid(combinedString);\n};\n```\n\nMeaning that `createUniqueUuid` will always return: `stringToUuid(\"user-knowledge:undefined\")` ie: `4e394ea6-af35-0010-8047-94bccb8b8e5b`\n\n### Expected Result\nThe generated ID should be unique, the easiest approach would be to us `stringToUuid` directly.\n\nIf possible, I would love to contribute. I can fix this issue, and others I've discovered.\n\nThanks,",

      "body": "## Problem\r\n\r\nThe knowledge plugin was experiencing consistent `\"Unexpected end of form\"` errors during file uploads, caused by **double parsing** of multipart form data:\r\n\r\n1. **Global middleware**: The main server (`eliza/packages/server/src/index.ts`) already applies a global `express-fileupload` middleware to all routes\r\n2. **Plugin middleware**: The knowledge plugin was applying its own middleware on top\r\n3. **Result**: Attempting to re-parse an already consumed stream → busboy error\r\n\r\n### Error logs\r\n```\r\nERROR: [KNOWLEDGE UPLOAD] Upload error:\r\n    message: \"Unexpected end of form\"\r\n    stack: \"Error: Unexpected end of form\r\n    at Multipart._final (/workspaces/node_modules/busboy/lib/types/multipart.js:588:17)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n**Remove duplicate middleware and use files already parsed by the global middleware.**\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\n#### 1. Removed duplicate express-fileupload / Multer configuration\r\n- ❌ Deleted `createUploadMiddleware()` function\r\n- ❌ Removed import\r\n- ❌ Eliminated custom middleware application logic\r\n- ✅ Simplified upload handler\r\n\r\n#### 3. Fixed file reading logic\r\nUpdated to prioritize temporary files (used by global middleware) over in-memory buffers:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// BEFORE: Assumed in-memory buffers\r\nif (file.data) { fileBuffer = file.data; }\r\n\r\n// AFTER: Prioritize temp files from global middleware\r\nif (filePath && fs.existsSync(filePath)) {\r\n  fileBuffer = await fs.promises.readFile(filePath);\r\n} else if (file.data && Buffer.isBuffer(file.data)) {\r\n  fileBuffer = file.data; // fallback\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- ✅ File uploads now work without \"Unexpected end of form\" errors\r\n- ✅ Both single and multiple file uploads tested\r\n- ✅ Large files (130KB+) upload successfully\r\n- ✅ Logging confirms files are read from temp files as expected\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n**None** - This is purely a bug fix that removes unnecessary duplicate processing.\r\n\r\n## Performance Impact\r\n\r\n- ⚡ **Faster uploads**: Eliminates duplicate parsing overhead\r\n- 🛡️ **More reliable**: Removes race conditions and connection issues\r\n- 🧹 **Cleaner code**: 80% reduction in middleware complexity\r\n\r\n## Files Changed\r\n\r\n- `plugin-knowledge/src/routes.ts`: Removed duplicate middleware, simplified upload handler\r\n\r\n## Migration Notes\r\n\r\nNo migration needed. The plugin now correctly uses the existing global `express-fileupload` middleware instead of creating its own conflicting instance.\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n- **Documentation**\n  - Added a new section explaining file upload configuration, supported file types, and MIME type handling to the troubleshooting guide.\n\n- **Chores**\n  - Removed unused dependencies related to file upload handling.\n\n- **Refactor**\n  - Replaced the previous file upload middleware with a global approach, improved file validation and error handling, and updated the upload process for better reliability.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
