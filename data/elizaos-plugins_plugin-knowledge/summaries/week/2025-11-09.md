# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's key achievement was a significant enhancement to the plugin's data processing capabilities. The migration to `unpdf` for PDF text extraction simplifies the architecture, reduces dependencies, and improves performance across different environments. While development focused on this core improvement, community engagement continued on future UI work, with a new contributor expressing interest in the ongoing "Dashboard Redesign" effort.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the plugin's core functionality for handling knowledge sources.

- **Enhanced PDF Text Extraction:** A major feature was merged to replace the `pdfjs-dist` library with `unpdf` for processing PDF files ([#46](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/46)). This change streamlines the text extraction process by eliminating complex worker configurations and significantly reducing the overall library size, ensuring more seamless and reliable PDF handling.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management was light this week, with a focus on an active design discussion and quick triage of a minor bug report.

- **Closed Issues:** An issue regarding the Web UI blocking endpoints was opened and quickly closed ([#6138](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6138)). It was determined to have been opened prematurely, though the underlying topic remains under investigation.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. Discussion continues on the "Dashboard Redesign" ([#6119](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6119)), which represents a significant piece of future work to rebuild the agent management dashboard with a new layout and filtering capabilities.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The project saw a positive sign of community growth and engagement this week. A new contributor, Rassakia, joined the discussion on the "Dashboard Redesign" issue ([#6119](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6119)), expressing interest in contributing to this major UI overhaul. This highlights active interest in the project's roadmap from the wider community.
