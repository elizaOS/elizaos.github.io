# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing agent capabilities within the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. A new feature was introduced to improve how agents identify and select reference documents, boosting context efficiency. Concurrently, a bug was reported concerning incorrect date displays for weekly summaries on user profiles, which has been acknowledged by the team for investigation.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the agent's ability to manage and understand its available knowledge sources.

- **Enhanced RAG Document Listing**
  A new static provider was implemented to allow agents to list available RAG documents and view their metadata, including filename, type, size, and source. This feature ([#45](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/45)) enables agents to identify relevant reference materials more efficiently without needing to process the full document content.
