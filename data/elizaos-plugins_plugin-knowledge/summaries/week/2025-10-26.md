# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing agent capabilities within the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. A new feature was introduced to improve how agents identify and select reference documents, making context utilization more efficient. Concurrently, a bug was reported and acknowledged concerning incorrect date displays on user profile summaries, which has been flagged for investigation.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
### RAG System Enhancements
To improve how agents interact with available knowledge, a new static provider was implemented to list RAG documents ([#45](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/45)). This feature allows agents to see document metadata—such as filename, type, and size—without loading the full content, enabling more efficient identification of relevant materials.
