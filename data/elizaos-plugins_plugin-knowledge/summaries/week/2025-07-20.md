# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on expanding the plugin's integration capabilities and addressing core infrastructure challenges. A significant development was the addition of Ollama as a supported provider, broadening the ecosystem of available models. Concurrently, work began on a major initiative to optimize the knowledge graph for improved performance. A critical logging compatibility issue affecting Bun builds was also tackled through a comprehensive migration to a new logging library, ensuring build stability without introducing breaking changes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this period centered on new features and critical infrastructure improvements.

*   **Provider Expansion**
    *   Support for Ollama was integrated as a new provider for both `plugin-knowledge` and embeddings. This new feature expands the range of services and models available to users ([#34](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/34)).

*   **Knowledge Graph Optimization**
    *   Initial work has commenced on optimizing the knowledge graph. This new initiative, tracked in PR [#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/35), aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of knowledge storage and retrieval.

*   **Logging System Migration for Build Compatibility**
    *   To resolve a critical build error with `pino-pretty` in Bun environments, a migration from `pino` to `adze` was undertaken. The work, tracked in issue [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5673), is now code-complete. An `ElizaLogger` wrapper class was created to maintain a `pino`-compatible API, preventing breaking changes across 182 files. The next steps involve final verification through testing and building.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.
*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. The primary focus remains on active issue [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5673), which addresses the logging library's incompatibility with Bun builds. A detailed plan has been executed, with the migration to `adze` now complete and pending final testing.
