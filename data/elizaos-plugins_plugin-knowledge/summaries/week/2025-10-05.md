# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were split between proactive enhancements and reactive troubleshooting. Significant progress was made on optimizing the knowledge graph's performance and memory management via PR [#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/35). Concurrently, a major community effort focused on diagnosing a critical import bug in issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6031), which was traced back to a faulty release of the core `@elizaos/core` package. Additionally, work was initiated to automate dependency management by introducing Renovate configuration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This week's development work centered on performance improvements and tooling.

- **Knowledge Graph Optimization**
  - In PR [#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/35), significant optimizations were implemented to improve the performance and memory footprint of the knowledge graph. Key enhancements include more efficient knowledge retrieval algorithms, improved memory management for large knowledge bases, and optimization of related frontend UI components like `src/frontend/ui/memory-graph-optimized.tsx`.

- **Dependency Management Automation**
  - A new pull request, [#41](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/41), was opened to add Renovate configuration. This aims to streamline project maintenance by automating future dependency updates.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was dominated by the investigation into a single, high-impact bug affecting a core dependency.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - The primary focus was on **[#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6031): Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61**. Discussions progressed from initial reports of import errors to a detailed root cause analysis. The community, through collaborative debugging, determined that version 1.6.1 of the `@elizaos/core` package was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. The recommended workaround for users is to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or a newer version. It was also suggested that the ElizaOS team consider deprecating or yanking the faulty v1.6.1 package from the registry to prevent further issues.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The collaborative spirit of the project was highly visible this week in the handling of issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6031). User @matteo-brandolino provided detailed diagnostic information, including `tsc` output and system details, which was crucial for debugging. Contributors @0xbbjoker and @wtfsayo engaged directly to guide the investigation. The detailed root cause analysis provided by Claude AI highlights the project's use of advanced tools to aid in complex problem-solving. This incident showcased effective collaboration between users and the development team to swiftly identify the source of a critical, external dependency issue.
