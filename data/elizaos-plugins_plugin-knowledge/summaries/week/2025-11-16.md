# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Nov 16 - 22, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing the plugin's usability by improving how document information is accessed. A key feature was introduced to the documents provider, exposing the list of available documents directly as a state value. This change simplifies the process of binding document context into prompts. Community discussion centered on expanding model compatibility, with an active conversation around integrating the Deepseek API with the ElizaOS framework.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
A targeted improvement was made to the documents provider to streamline its integration with other components.

- **Document State Exposure for Easier Prompting:** A new feature was merged to expose available documents as a state value, making it easier for developers to bind this information into prompts. This update to the `documents-provider` now returns a formatted list of documents along with a count via new `values` fields. The work, completed in PR [#47](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/47), also included dependency updates and refined error handling.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was focused on addressing user inquiries rather than opening or closing bug reports.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. An ongoing discussion in issue [#6156](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6156) addresses a user inquiry about using the Deepseek API. Community members suggested two potential pathways: using the OpenAI plugin if the Deepseek API is OpenAI-compatible, or leveraging `plugin-openrouter` for custom model configurations.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was highlighted by the collaborative problem-solving in the active issues. The discussion around Deepseek API integration ([#6156](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6156)) demonstrates users actively helping one another find solutions to extend the capabilities of ElizaOS, pointing to a healthy and supportive ecosystem.
