# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on improving the plugin's deployment flexibility and addressing a critical stability issue. A significant new feature introduced a configurable plugin factory, enabling the plugin to operate in both `core` and `headless` modes for greater environmental adaptability. Concurrently, the team swiftly resolved a critical CLI module resolution error that was preventing users from running the tool after installation. The fix was identified as a package bundling issue and was promptly patched and released in version 1.6.3, restoring full functionality for users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on a single, impactful enhancement to the plugin's architecture.

### **Enhanced Deployment Flexibility**
- To support a wider range of use cases, the plugin factory was updated to be configurable with `core` and `headless` modes. This change allows the plugin to be deployed in different environments, such as servers without a graphical interface. The work, completed in [#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/44), also included updates to documentation and the addition of export tests to ensure the integrity of the new factory modes.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was focused on resolving a high-priority bug affecting the command-line interface.

- **Closed Issues:** A critical bug ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6088)) causing a `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` error for users of the ElizaOS CLI was resolved. The root cause was traced to a bundling problem in the published npm package. A new version of the CLI (1.6.3) was released to correct the issue.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported this week, and no other major issues remain active based on the latest reports.
