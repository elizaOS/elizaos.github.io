# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by significant feature enhancements to the knowledge plugin, alongside a concerted effort to resolve critical bugs across the broader ElizaOS ecosystem. Key achievements include the introduction of a vector search UI and support for custom LLM providers, greatly expanding the plugin's data processing and retrieval capabilities. Concurrently, the team successfully closed several long-standing issues, most notably resolving a persistent bug with plugin action callbacks not reaching the user. This dual focus on new features and system-wide stability demonstrates a commitment to both innovation and a reliable user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on adding powerful new features to the knowledge plugin and addressing critical data handling and CLI issues.

- **Enhanced LLM Integration and Search:**
  - A major feature was merged to allow the use of custom LLM providers for document processing, complete with configurable caching. This gives users more flexibility and improves performance ([#13](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/13)).
  - To complement this, a new vector search capability was added to the UI, serving as a practical example of semantic search within the Knowledge tab ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/23)).

- **Critical Data Integrity and Bug Fixes:**
  - A bug causing non-unique Knowledge/Memory IDs was resolved, ensuring reliable storage and retrieval of memories in `actions.ts` ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/17)).
  - An invalid regular expression for base64 content validation was corrected in `service.ts` and refactored into a utility function for better maintainability ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/18)).

- **CLI Update Guidance:**
  - A solution was provided for the `elizaos update` command, advising users to run `bun install -g @elizaos/cli@latest` to ensure the CLI updates correctly.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on closing out persistent bugs related to inter-plugin communication, API endpoints, and CLI functionality, while new discussions centered on future architectural improvements.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Plugin & Agent Communication:** A significant, long-standing issue where callbacks from plugin actions (e.g., `plugin-evm`) failed to reach the user chat was successfully resolved and closed after community verification ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5017)). An issue with successive agent replies was also fixed ([#4940](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/4940)).
  - **API & Integration:** Issues regarding a missing `/api/agents/{agentId}/rooms` endpoint ([#5121](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5121)) and REST API room creation failures ([#4955](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/4955)) were closed, with clarification provided on the architectural shift from "rooms" to "channels." The request for Bedrock LLM support ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5117)) was also closed with the release of a dedicated plugin.
  - **CLI Functionality:** Problems with the `elizaos update` command ([#5198](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5198)) and the `elizaos/cli test` command ([#5142](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5142)) were resolved.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Frontend Testing:** A new pull request was opened to add Cypress and other end-to-end tests, signaling a move to improve frontend robustness ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/24)).
  - **Logger Customization:** A significant discussion is ongoing around allowing downstream projects to customize the root logger configuration, as the current implementation is too restrictive. A comprehensive solution is being planned ([#5183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5183)).
  - **Version Mismatch:** A recurring issue where the web client displays an incorrect version compared to the CLI and core remains active, despite previous attempts to fix it ([#4924](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/4924)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong, collaborative problem-solving within the community. The resolution of the plugin callback issue ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5017)) was a prime example, with multiple users (@0xbbjoker, @jonathanprozzi, @alex-nax) actively testing, providing feedback, and verifying the final fix. This interaction was crucial in closing a complex and persistent bug. Additionally, maintainers demonstrated responsiveness by providing direct guidance on issues like checking loaded plugins ([#4931](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/4931)) and updating the CLI ([#5198](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5198)), fostering a supportive environment for all contributors.
