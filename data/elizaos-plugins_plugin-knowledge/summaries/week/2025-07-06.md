# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Jul 6 - 12, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on enhancing the project's long-term health and stability. A significant refactoring initiative improved code quality by updating dependencies and strengthening type safety throughout the codebase. While development focused on internal improvements, key community-reported issues regarding plugin compatibility were actively discussed. These discussions led to clarifications on fixes for the Twitter and local-ai plugins, with a strategic decision noted to deprecate the local-ai plugin in favor of Ollama.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary focus was on foundational codebase improvements rather than new features.

### Codebase Refinements and Dependency Management
A substantial refactoring effort was completed to improve the overall maintainability and robustness of the plugin. This work, captured in PR [#33](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/33), involved a comprehensive update of dependencies, enhancements to TypeScript type safety, and a simplification of the logging mechanisms within the `KnowledgeService`. These changes streamline the codebase and prepare it for future development.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed this week, but there was important activity on existing problems.

### New & Active Issues
Discussions on active issues provided crucial feedback and clarification for users:
*   **Plugin Loading & Compatibility:** In issue [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5499) (`Plugin-local-ai failing to load on Windows`), a user confirmed the problem also exists on Mac. The conversation clarified that while `v1.2.1` contains a fix, the `local-ai` plugin is being deprecated in favor of Ollama, with hosted models being the primary workaround for now.
*   **Twitter Client Failures:** Users continued to report failures creating the Twitter client in issue [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/36). The issue was subsequently marked as resolved by the `1.2.0` update.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
