## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, tests added, or other work were completed and merged on this day.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Frontend Test Enhancements:** A new pull request, [#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/24), was opened to add frontend tests, including Cypress and additional end-to-end tests and scenarios.

## CLOSED ISSUES
- **Agent Reply Behavior Fixes:** The issue of successive replies from agents on target users, [#4940](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/4940), was confirmed as fixed.
- **REST API Room Creation Resolution:** The problem where creating a room via the REST API initially worked but then returned an empty rooms array, [#4955](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/4955), was resolved. The discussion highlighted the transition from "rooms" to "channels" and the need for a message to be sent to the room for the agent to register.

The latest comments indicate that updates to the CLI and `plugin-evm` resolved the issue for some users, though `plugin-mcp` responses are still being verified.
- **Bedrock Integration:** The request for Bedrock LLM integration, [#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5117), was closed with the release of a dedicated `plugin-bedrock`.
