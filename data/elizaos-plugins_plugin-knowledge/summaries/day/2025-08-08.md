## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Build Failures in Core Components
- **üêõ Build failure in @elizaos/core causing bun run clean to fail** ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5738)): This issue, identified during a morning call, describes a failure in the `bun run clean` command due to TypeScript errors in the `@elizaos/core` package during the type definition build phase. The issue is confirmed to exist on the latest branch and is blocking testing of advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading. The team is awaiting a fix to proceed with complex scenario testing.

### Eliza CLI Build Failures
- **Eliza CLI failed to build project** ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5734)): This issue reports that the ElizaOS CLI fails to build projects, specifically due to a TypeScript error related to argument types in `src/index.ts`. A potential fix was identified, suggesting that a placeholder `%s` is missing in `logger.info` calls, which was confirmed to resolve the issue. It was also noted that this might have been fixed in version 1.4.x.
