## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Build Failures in Core Packages
- **üêõ Build failure in @elizaos/core causing bun run clean to fail** ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5738)): This issue, created today, reports that the `bun run clean` command is failing due to TypeScript errors in the `@elizaos/core` package during the type definition build phase. The latest comment from `monilpat` confirms the issue exists on the latest branch, blocks testing of advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading, and was identified during a morning call.

### Eliza CLI Project Build Failures
- **Eliza CLI failed to build project** ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5734)): This issue, created yesterday, describes a failure when the ElizaOS CLI attempts to build a new project, specifically a `TS2345` error related to argument types in `src/index.ts`. The latest comment from `wtfsayo` suggests the issue might be fixed in version 1.4.x, while an earlier comment from `Kemystra` identified the root cause as a missing placeholder in `logger.info` calls within templates, providing a fix.
