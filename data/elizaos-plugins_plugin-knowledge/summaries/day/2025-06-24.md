## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Custom Plugin Callback Interference ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/4947))
Discussions continue regarding an issue where custom plugin action callbacks are being replaced by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider's content. A user confirmed the issue is still present in version 1.0.11. A detailed analysis by "claude" identified the root cause in the message handler flow where the `ATTACHMENTS` provider modifies the state before it's passed to action handlers. Recommendations include modifying the message handler to process action callbacks before providers or isolating action callbacks from provider state. A fix is being worked on for version 1.2.4.

### On-chain AI Agent Plugin Development Challenges ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5260))
Users are experiencing difficulties developing custom plugins for on-chain AI agents, specifically with the agent stopping after one message and not consistently using plugins. One user noted that the agent might reply correctly in the terminal but not on the interface. A potential solution suggested is to ensure responses are sent either via callback or return in the action, but not both.

### Documentation Overhaul for User and Developer Tracks ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5234))
Feedback highlights the need for separate documentation tracks for simple users and developers. A user expressed frustration with scattered and inconsistent documentation, citing issues with environment variables and outdated example JSON files.
