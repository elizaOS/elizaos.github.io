# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Dec 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the `plugin-knowledge` repository saw a significant feature addition with configurable rate limits for high-throughput APIs. Several new issues were also opened, primarily focusing on UI/UX and documentation improvements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced API Rate Limiting
A new feature was introduced to add configurable rate limits for high-throughput APIs. This includes an option to completely disable rate limiting and settings for `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`, `REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, `TOKENS_PER_MINUTE`, and `BATCH_DELAY_MS`. Default limits were also increased fivefold for high-throughput APIs. ([#49](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/49))

## NEW ISSUES

### Agent Chat and Conversation Management
Two new issues were opened regarding agent chat functionality. One addresses the need for opening the most recent conversation when accessing an agent from "My Agents/Dashboard" ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6281)). The other highlights a bug where conversations are duplicated when switching between agents ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6282)).

### UI/UX and Documentation Improvements
A new issue was created to address spacing problems in numbered list items ([#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6283)). Additionally, a task was opened to fix monorepo documentation ([#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6284)).
