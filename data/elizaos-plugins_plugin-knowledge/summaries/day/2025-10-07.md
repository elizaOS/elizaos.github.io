### Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6031))
The discussion today centered on diagnosing the `Module '"@Elizaos/core"' has no exported member` error when using Eliza CLI 1.61. Claude AI provided a detailed root cause analysis, identifying that version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core` was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files, specifically for exports like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime`. The issue is confirmed to be version-specific to 1.6.1 and environment-independent. Recommendations include upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later and for the ElizaOS team to consider deprecating v1.6.1 and adding publish-time validation. User @matteo-brandolino provided their Node (v24.9.0), Bun (1.2.22), and OS details, confirming the issue persists on their end. @wtfsayo inquired if the user's OS is Windows.
