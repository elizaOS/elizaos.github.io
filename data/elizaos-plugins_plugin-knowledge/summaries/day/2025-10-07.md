### Eliza CLI Import Errors ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6031))
Discussions continued regarding the `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61` issue.
- **Root Cause Identified:** Claude's analysis confirmed that the problem is specific to `@elizaos/core@1.6.1`, which was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. Essential exports like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` are present in the source code but were not properly exposed in the published package's `.d.ts` files.
- **Recommendations:** Users are advised to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later. The ElizaOS team is recommended to consider deprecating v1.6.1 and implement publish-time validation to prevent similar issues.
- **User Environment Details:** @matteo-brandolino provided their environment details (Node v24.9.0, Bun 1.2.22, Arch Linux) to assist with further investigation, confirming the issue is not specific to Windows.
- **Ongoing Investigation:** @wtfsayo and @0xbbjoker are actively investigating the issue, with @0xbbjoker initially unable to reproduce it in a fresh environment.
