### CLI Module Resolution Error
Issue [#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6088) reports a "Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'" error after installing the ElizaOS CLI. The issue was created on October 22nd and closed today, October 23rd. The latest comments confirm that version 1.6.3 of the CLI has fixed the problem, with users confirming it works after reinstalling. Earlier discussions included workarounds such as running the CLI from a local clone or directly executing the `dist/index.js` file. The root cause was identified as a bundling issue in the published npm package.
