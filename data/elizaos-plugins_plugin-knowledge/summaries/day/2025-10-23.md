### CLI Module Resolution Error
The issue regarding `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` after installing the ElizaOS CLI ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6088)) was actively discussed and resolved. The problem was identified as a bundling issue in the published npm package. A new version (1.6.3) was released to fix this, and users confirmed the fix after re-installing the CLI. Earlier discussions included workarounds such as using the CLI from a local clone or running the CLI directly from its `dist` folder.
