# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Jun 16, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today, the `plugin-knowledge` repository saw significant progress with the addition of a new vector search feature to the UI, alongside critical bug fixes addressing base64 regex validation and unique knowledge/memory IDs.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Knowledge Management and Search
A new feature has been implemented to add vector search capabilities to the UI, serving as an educational example for semantic search within the Knowledge tab. This enhances how users can interact with and retrieve information. ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/23))

### Critical Bug Fixes for Data Handling
Two important bug fixes were deployed:
- An invalid regular expression used for base64 content validation in `service.ts` was corrected and moved to a utility function for better maintainability. ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/18))
- A bug causing non-unique Knowledge/Memory IDs in `actions.ts` was resolved, ensuring proper storage and retrieval of memories. ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/17))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### CLI and Plugin Integration Issues Resolved
Several issues related to CLI commands and plugin integration were closed:
- The `agent-twitter-client` repository's status was clarified, noting its removal due to a cease and desist request from X. ([#5074](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5074))
- An issue regarding the `elizaos/cli test` command incorrectly requiring a monorepo root for standalone projects was closed, with confirmation that the issue has been resolved. ([#5142](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5142))

### API Endpoint and LLM Integration Updates
API and LLM integration concerns were addressed:
- The `/api/agents/{agentId}/rooms` endpoint not being found was resolved, clarifying the transition to a channel-based messaging architecture and providing updated API endpoints for messaging. ([#5121](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5121))
- The integration of Bedrock as an LLM was discussed, with a new plugin for Bedrock being released to address the lack of direct CLI options. ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5117))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Callback from Plugin Action Not Reaching User Response
Issue [#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5017) discusses a problem where callbacks from plugin actions (e.g., `plugin-evm` transfer function) are not making it to the end-user response in the chat.
- **Latest Update (Jun 16, 2025):** @0xbbjoker suggested cleaning `node_modules`, `dist`, and `bun.lock` and ensuring `package.json` is clean to avoid old versions. @jonathanprozzi confirmed he updated to `1.0.9` but still didn't see responses, planning a fresh project test. @alex-nax noted an unwanted reply before the desired action, even with the fix. @0xbbjoker also advised prompting the agent to understand action combinations. The issue remains active with ongoing testing and troubleshooting.

### Service Types and Test Services
Issue [#4914](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/4914) proposes grouping services into types and building abstract plugins that depend on other services (e.g., a trading plugin using `runtime.getServicesByType('wallet')`).
- **Latest Update (Jun 16, 2025):** @elisafalk inquired if the issue is still relevant and offered to be assigned. The issue was later closed on July 15, 2025, with a detailed summary from Claude indicating successful implementation of service types and test services, including new interfaces, dummy services, and a comprehensive test suite. This indicates significant progress and resolution of the initial request.
