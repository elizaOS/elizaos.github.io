### Deepseek API Integration Inquiry
*   An inquiry was made regarding the possibility of using the Deepseek API with ElizaOS. A user suggested that if Deepseek is OpenAI compatible, it might work by providing the API endpoint to the OpenAI plugin. Alternatively, it was confirmed that Deepseek can be used with `plugin-openrouter`, with a link provided for configuring custom models.
