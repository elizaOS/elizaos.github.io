### Deepseek API Integration Inquiry
*   An inquiry was made regarding the possibility of using the Deepseek API with the plugin. A user suggested that if Deepseek is OpenAI compatible, it might work by providing the API endpoint to Deepseek. Alternatively, it was noted that Deepseek can definitely be used with `plugin-openrouter`, and a link to configure custom models was provided.
