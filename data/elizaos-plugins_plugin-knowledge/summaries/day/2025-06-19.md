### Resolution of Plugin Action Callback Issues
The issue where callbacks from plugin actions were not reaching the end-user response in chat has been resolved and closed. This fix ensures that success or failure messages from plugin actions, such as `plugin-evm` transfers, are properly communicated back to the user.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Customizable Root Logger Configuration
Discussions continue on allowing downstream projects to customize the root logger configuration. The issue highlights that current projects cannot modify transports, only create child loggers. A comprehensive solution is being developed, including a delayed initialization system, a new logger configuration interface, and CLI integration to apply custom settings during startup. An example configuration with CloudWatch, file, and HTTP transports is also being prepared. ([#5183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5183))
