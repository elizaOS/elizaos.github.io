## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Deployment Strategies for Eliza Agents
Discussions continued on the best ways to deploy custom Eliza agents ([#5244](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5244)). @bealers shared their work on "elizify," a project aiming for easy, secure, and reproducible Eliza installations, including a `docker compose up` solution and a goal for one-click Coolify install. @wtfsayo suggested Railway and Render as potential platforms. @kamalbuilds highlighted challenges with existing options like Fleek and Relay for custom agents. The latest comment from @claude indicates progress on creating `railway.json` and Render blueprint files, along with a `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide, to address this issue.

### Documentation Overhaul
The ongoing discussion for a documentation overhaul to create separate tracks for simple users and developers ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5234)) saw a new comment from @Ifechukwudaniel requesting assignment to the issue. Earlier, @Megamindmaster provided extensive feedback from a new user's perspective, highlighting inconsistencies in environment variables across different files and the difficulty for non-developers to set up example JSON files like Jarvis.

### CLI Input Method Consistency
The issue of migrating remaining CLI input methods to use `@clack/prompts` for consistency ([#5295](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5295)) also received a new comment from @Ifechukwudaniel requesting assignment. @wtfsayo encouraged contributors to work on it and submit a PR.

### Test Consistency Across Packages
The issue concerning inconsistent `bun run test` functionality across all packages ([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5218)) saw a new comment from @ai16z-demirix, who stated they have started working on it and made progress on phase 1, taking responsibility for the complete issue.
