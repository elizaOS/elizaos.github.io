## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Plugin Loading and Compatibility Issues
Discussions continued regarding the `Plugin-local-ai failing to load on Windows` issue ([#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5499)). On July 10th, `scottrepreneur` reported experiencing the same issue on Mac with `v1.2.0`, suggesting that using hosted models is the primary workaround. Later comments indicate a fix was released in `v1.2.1` and the local-ai plugin is being deprecated in favor of Ollama.

### Twitter Client Initialization Failures
The `Failed to create Twitter Client (1.0.14)` issue ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/36)) saw continued reports of the same error on July 10th from `yasir23`. This indicates the problem persisted for users attempting to migrate agents and integrate the Twitter plugin. The issue was later marked as fixed with the 1.2.0 update.
