### Plugin Loading Failures
Discussions continued regarding the `Plugin-local-ai` failing to load on Windows ([#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5499)). On July 10th, a user reported experiencing the same issue on Mac with `v1.2.0`, suggesting that using hosted models is the primary workaround. The issue was later marked for deprecation of the local-ai plugin in favor of Ollama, with a note that local-ai might work on a second startup.

### Twitter Client Authentication Issues
The issue of `Failed to create Twitter Client` ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/36)) persisted, with a user on July 10th confirming they were experiencing the same error. This issue was later resolved with the 1.2.0 update.
