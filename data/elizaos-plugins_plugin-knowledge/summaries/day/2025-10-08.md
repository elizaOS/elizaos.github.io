### Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61 [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6031)
Discussion continued on the `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61` issue. @matteo-brandolino confirmed their OS as Arch Linux, following up on @wtfsayo's query about the operating system. This further supports the diagnosis that the issue is not environment-specific but rather a problem with the `@elizaos/core` package version 1.6.1 itself, as previously detailed by `claude`'s root cause analysis. The core problem identified is missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core`, making exports like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` unavailable. The recommended immediate solution is to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later.
