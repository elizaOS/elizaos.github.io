Issue [#5279](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5279), "No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING", was closed. The resolution involved adding the `@elizaos/plugin-openai` to the agent character file's plugin list, which resolved the `TEXT_EMBEDDING` handler error and allowed the agent to reply successfully.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Custom Plugin Development Challenges**
Issue [#5260](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5260), "Create custom plugin for onchain AI agent", continues to be active. The latest comment from `wtfsayo` (Jun 30) suggests that the issue might be related to sending responses via both callback and return in the action, advising to use only one method. `omariosman` (Jun 25) also reported similar difficulties with custom plugin development errors. `yehia67` (Jun 24) highlighted an issue where agent replies appear in the terminal but not on the interface logs, along with repeated "no entity" warnings.

**Twitter Plugin Reply Formatting and Functionality**
Issue [#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/26), "Newlines in timeline replies are replaced with \\n\\n instead of actual line breaks", remains active. `gnomonprime` (Jun 25) identified that the Twitter plugin's template explicitly instructs the agent to use "\\n\\n" for newlines, which causes them to appear as raw text instead of actual line breaks.

Issue [#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/29), "Twitter plugin not posting replies to mentions or tags", is also active. `gnomonprime` (Jun 25) noted that their agent sometimes exhibits similar behavior, where memories are saved but responses are not delivered, suggesting it might be a random occurrence also observed in the web UI.
