### Eliza CLI Import Errors with Version 1.6.1
Discussion continued on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6031) regarding `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61`. The latest comment from matteo-brandolino suggests the issue might stem from missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package (version 1.6.1), specifically referencing source files not included in the published package. Downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 appears to resolve the problem.
