**AI Provider Integration**
*   **Feature: Native Venice AI Provider Integration** ([#5820](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5820)): The latest comment from wtfsayo suggests that privacy-focused, uncensored AI providers can be integrated by modifying the base URL environment variable for the OpenAI plugin or by using the dedicated Venice plugin. This indicates that the requested functionality might already be achievable through existing mechanisms or dedicated plugins.
