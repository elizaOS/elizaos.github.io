## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Bun Build Compatibility for Logging:**
    *   Issue [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5673) addresses `pino-pretty` errors in export builds from Bun, proposing to replace `pino` with `adze`.
    *   A detailed plan for migrating from `pino` to `adze` has been outlined, including analysis of current `pino` usage, research into `adze` API, and steps for implementation.
    *   The migration is reported as "code-complete," with `adze@^2.2.8` replacing `pino@^9.6.0` and `pino-pretty@^13.0.0`.
    *   An `ElizaLogger` class has been created to wrap `adze` with a `pino`-compatible API, ensuring zero breaking changes for 182 files using the logger.
    *   Key features like custom log levels, `InMemoryDestination`, environment variable support, Sentry integration, and agent context binding have been preserved.
    *   Next steps involve running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build` to fully verify the migration.
