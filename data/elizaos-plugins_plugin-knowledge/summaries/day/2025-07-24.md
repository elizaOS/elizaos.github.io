## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Logger Compatibility with Bun Builds**
    *   [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5673) `pino-pretty errors in export builds from bun - replace pino with adze`: This issue addresses a critical problem where the current logger (`pino`) is incompatible with Bun's binary compilation process, causing errors in export builds.
    *   **Progress**: An automated agent (Claude) has completed the migration from `pino` to `adze` to resolve the compatibility issues. The migration involved replacing `pino` and `pino-pretty` dependencies with `adze`, implementing an `ElizaLogger` class with a `pino`-compatible API, and preserving all existing logging functionalities (custom log levels, memory buffering, environment configuration, Sentry integration, etc.).
    *   **Next Steps**: The code migration is complete and committed to a branch. Verification steps include running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build` to confirm the fix and ensure all tests pass and compilation works as expected.
