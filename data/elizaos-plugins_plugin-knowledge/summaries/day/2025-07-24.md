# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Jul 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in expanding the plugin's capabilities with new provider support and ongoing efforts to optimize the knowledge graph. A critical logging compatibility issue for Bun builds was also addressed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **New Provider Integration:**
    *   Added Ollama as a supported provider for `plugin-knowledge` and embeddings, expanding the range of available models and services. [#34](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/34)
*   **Knowledge Graph Optimization:**
    *   Initiated work on optimizing the knowledge graph, aiming to improve performance and efficiency. [#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/35)
*   **Bun Build Compatibility for Logging:**
    *   A critical issue regarding `pino-pretty` errors in export builds from Bun was identified and addressed. The proposed solution involves replacing `pino` with `adze` to ensure compatibility. This work is being tracked under an active issue.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Logger Compatibility for Bun Builds:**
    *   Issue [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5673) "pino-pretty errors in export builds from bun - replace pino with adze" was created to address the incompatibility of the current logger with Bun's binary compilation process.
    *   A detailed plan for migrating from `pino` to `adze` has been outlined, including steps for analyzing current usage, researching `adze` API, updating dependencies, implementing a `pino`-compatible API with `adze`, preserving custom log levels, and maintaining environment variable configuration.
    *   The migration is reported as "code-complete," with `pino` and `pino-pretty` replaced by `adze`. The `ElizaLogger` class has been rewritten to wrap `adze` while maintaining a `pino`-compatible API, ensuring zero breaking changes across 182 files.
    *   Next steps involve running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build` to fully verify the migration and confirm the resolution of the original Bun binary issues.
