# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
September was a month of targeted enhancements focused on improving user experience and developer infrastructure. The most significant development was a fix for the knowledge panel loading issue, which also introduced a new in-app PDF viewer with enhanced controls. Concurrently, key infrastructure and UI issues were resolved, including the dockerization of `project-starter` and improvements to CLI testing. Discussions continued around expanding AI provider support, signaling a focus on future extensibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on a critical user-facing bug fix that also delivered a valuable feature enhancement.

- **Knowledge Panel and PDF Viewer Enhancement**
  - A fix was implemented for knowledge panel loading issues, improving reliability for users. As part of this work, a new in-app PDF viewer was introduced, complete with zoom and reset functionalities. To improve the user experience when content is unavailable, the viewer now displays a "PDF Not Available" message. This work was addressed in PR [#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/39).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month focused on closing out existing tasks related to tooling and UI, while discussions progressed on future feature integrations.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **CLI and UI Enhancements:** Two issues were resolved to improve the user and developer experience. The CLI's continuous integration tests were confirmed to be functional ([#5714](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5714)), and a feature to display the action called and its result in the chat UI was completed ([#5831](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5831)).
  - **Project Setup Improvements:** The task to dockerize the `project-starter` was completed, simplifying project setup and improving environment consistency ([#5842](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5842)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - No new issues were opened during this period.
  - Discussion continued on the active issue [#5820](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5820) regarding native integration for the Venice AI provider. A key suggestion emerged that privacy-focused, uncensored AI providers could be supported by modifying the base URL environment variable for the existing OpenAI plugin, offering a potential path forward without requiring a completely new integration.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was evident in the ongoing strategic discussions about the project's direction. The conversation around integrating new AI providers in issue [#5820](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5820) highlights community engagement in shaping future features, with contributors like `wtfsayo` providing technical suggestions that influence the implementation strategy.
