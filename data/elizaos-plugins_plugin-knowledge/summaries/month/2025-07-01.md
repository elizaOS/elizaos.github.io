# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July's development efforts centered on enhancing the foundational quality and maintainability of the plugin. A significant refactoring effort improved type safety and updated dependencies, setting the stage for future feature development. Community feedback was instrumental in addressing persistent issues, leading to the resolution of bugs related to the Twitter and local-ai plugins. Notably, this period also saw a strategic decision to deprecate the `local-ai` plugin in favor of Ollama, signaling a shift in the project's approach to local model integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on internal improvements rather than new features, ensuring the long-term health of the codebase.

- **Codebase Refinements and Dependency Updates**
  A key pull request ([#33](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/33)) was merged to address technical debt and modernize the project. This refactoring effort included bumping package versions, strengthening TypeScript type safety, and simplifying the logging mechanisms within the `KnowledgeService`. These changes result in a more robust, efficient, and maintainable plugin.
