# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
Development in October focused on foundational infrastructure and critical bug investigation. The project's maintenance posture was improved with the integration of automated dependency management via Renovate. Significant effort was also directed toward diagnosing a module import issue related to a specific version of the Eliza CLI, highlighting a potential bug in a core dependency that impacts project scaffolding.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving the project's long-term health and maintainability.

- **Dependency Management Automation**
  To ensure dependencies remain current and secure, a Renovate configuration was introduced. This automates the process of creating pull requests for dependency updates, reducing manual maintenance overhead for the team ([#41](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/41)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on investigating a significant compatibility problem.

- **Closed Issues:**
  Based on the available reports, no issues were closed this month.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  No new issues were opened, but a critical discussion continued around issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6031). This active issue concerns a `Module '"@Elizaos/core"' has no exported member 'logger'` error that occurs when creating new projects with Eliza CLI version 1.6.1. Investigation suggests the root cause may be incorrect type definition file paths within the `@Elizaos/core` package itself. The current workarounds involve either downgrading to version 1.5.15 or upgrading to a version newer than 1.6.1, indicating a version-specific bug.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the focused effort to troubleshoot the active module import issue. The discussion on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6031) involved detailed analysis, with contributor `matteo-brandolino` providing key insights into the potential cause, demonstrating active community engagement in resolving core problems.
