# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December's development focused on enhancing the performance and scalability of the `plugin-knowledge` repository. Two significant features were introduced to improve throughput and efficiency: configurable rate limiting for high-throughput APIs and a new batch embedding pipeline for document processing. Alongside these backend improvements, several new issues were opened, highlighting a concurrent focus on refining the user experience, particularly in agent conversation management and UI presentation. The project's issue triage process demonstrated a high degree of automation, ensuring new issues received immediate and structured attention.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on optimizing the plugin's core functionalities for better performance under load.

- **API Performance and Stability:** To better manage high-volume API interactions, a new feature for configurable rate limiting was introduced. This update provides settings for `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`, `REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, `TOKENS_PER_MINUTE`, and an option to disable limits entirely. As part of this change, default limits for high-throughput APIs were increased fivefold ([#49](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/49)).

- **Document Processing Efficiency:** A batch embedding pipeline was implemented to optimize the performance of document processing. By introducing `EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE=100` and the corresponding logic in `document-processor.ts`, the system can now generate embeddings in batches, leading to more efficient resource utilization ([#50](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/50)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No issues were closed during this reporting period. However, several new issues were opened and immediately triaged, indicating areas for future work.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Agent Conversation Management:** Two related issues were created to improve the agent chat experience. The first proposes opening the most recent conversation when selecting an agent ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6281)), while the second reports a bug where conversations are duplicated when switching between agents ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6282)).
    - **UI/UX and Documentation:** Minor but important user-facing improvements were requested, including fixing spacing in numbered lists ([#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6283)) and addressing issues in the monorepo documentation ([#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6284)).

All newly opened issues received immediate attention from the `coderabbitai` bot, which automatically generated implementation plans and suggested potential assignees, streamlining the initial triage process.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration during this period was characterized by a highly efficient, bot-assisted workflow. The `coderabbitai` bot played a central role in the initial response to all new issues, providing structured plans that facilitate quicker developer handoff. The bot's suggestions for assignees, such as `borisudovicic`, `linear`, and `yungalgo`, point to their active roles in specific domains within the project. This automated process ensures that new contributions and bug reports are processed systematically, reflecting a mature and organized approach to project maintenance.
