# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
August was a month focused on stability and addressing critical bugs. A significant effort was dedicated to investigating a plugin crash caused by the `pdfjs-dist` dependency. While no new features were added, a key fix was implemented to standardize logger compatibility across the codebase. Progress was partially hampered by build failures in upstream dependencies like `@elizaos/core` and the Eliza CLI, which are currently blocking further testing and development within this plugin.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving the plugin's reliability and maintainability through targeted bug fixes.

- **Logger Compatibility Fix:** A fix was merged to standardize error logging throughout the plugin ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/38)). This effort, touching multiple files including `actions.ts`, `docs-loader.ts`, and `service.ts`, ensures logging is more consistent and readable, which is crucial for future debugging efforts.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The issue tracker saw activity focused on identifying and diagnosing critical bugs, both within the plugin and in core ElizaOS components.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in August.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Plugin Stability:** A high-priority issue was opened concerning a plugin crash related to `pdfjs-dist` ([#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/37)). Initial investigation to reproduce the `TypeError: process.getBuiltinModule is not a function` error was unsuccessful, and the team is awaiting more detailed information from the issue reporter to proceed.
    - **Upstream Blockers:** Development and testing are currently impacted by build failures in other parts of the ElizaOS ecosystem. These include a build failure in `@elizaos/core` ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5738)) that prevents the `bun run clean` command from succeeding, and an Eliza CLI build failure ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5734)) related to a TypeScript error. These external issues must be resolved to unblock testing of more complex scenarios for the knowledge plugin.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was characterized by responsive debugging and cross-team communication. The investigation into the `pdfjs-dist` crash ([#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/37)) shows active engagement between developers and the issue reporter. Furthermore, the identification of an upstream blocker during a "morning call" ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5738)) highlights the team's awareness of and communication about inter-dependencies within the broader ElizaOS project.
