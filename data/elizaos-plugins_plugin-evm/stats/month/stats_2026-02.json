      "body": "## Summary\n\n- Adds multi-provider RPC abstraction supporting Alchemy (29 chains), Infura (27 chains), Ankr (25 chains), and Eliza Cloud proxy (32 chains)\n- `EVM_RPC_PROVIDER` setting selects preferred provider with automatic fallback\n- Per-chain custom RPC overrides always take highest priority\n- Startup validation warns when no provider is configured\n- Adds `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`, `INFURA_API_KEY`, `ANKR_API_KEY` to pluginParameters schema\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] 45 unit tests covering URL construction, priority ordering, fallback, edge cases\n- [x] 16 live integration tests against real Alchemy endpoints (ETH mainnet, Base verified)\n- [x] All tests pass: `bun vitest run __tests__/unit/ __tests__/integration/`\n\nMade with [Cursor](https://cursor.com)\n\n<!-- greptile_comment -->\n\n<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>\n\n<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>\n\nThis PR adds a robust multi-provider RPC abstraction layer that supports Alchemy (29 chains), Infura (27 chains), Ankr (25 chains), and Eliza Cloud proxy (32 chains). The implementation provides automatic fallback when a preferred provider doesn't support a specific chain, while maintaining backward compatibility with per-chain custom RPC URLs.\n\n**Key changes:**\n- New `rpc-providers.ts` module with provider factory pattern and chain mapping\n- `EVM_RPC_PROVIDER` setting for provider preference with automatic fallback\n- Priority ordering: custom RPC URLs > preferred provider > other providers > viem defaults\n- Startup validation with helpful warnings when no provider is configured\n- 45 unit tests and 16 live integration tests with 100% pass rate\n\n**Minor issue:**\n- Custom RPC URLs are incorrectly labeled as `\"alchemy\"` provider in logs (line 256 of `rpc-providers.ts`), which could cause confusion during debugging. Consider adding `\"custom\"` to the `RPCProviderName` type union.\n\n<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>\n\n- Safe to merge with one minor logging inconsistency that doesn't affect functionality\n- Strong implementation with comprehensive test coverage (61 total tests), proper error handling, and clean architecture. The only issue is cosmetic - custom RPC URLs are mislabeled in logs. No breaking changes, security issues, or logic errors detected.\n- typescript/rpc-providers.ts - address the custom RPC provider name labeling issue\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| typescript/rpc-providers.ts | New multi-provider RPC abstraction with support for Alchemy, Infura, Ankr, and Eliza Cloud. Minor issue: custom RPC URLs incorrectly labeled as \"alchemy\" provider in logs. |\n| typescript/providers/wallet.ts | Integrates new RPC provider manager into wallet initialization. Clean refactoring that replaces direct environment variable reads with centralized provider resolution. |\n| typescript/__tests__/unit/rpc-providers.test.ts | Comprehensive unit tests covering provider resolution, fallback logic, priority ordering, and edge cases. 45 test cases provide excellent coverage. |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Runtime as IAgentRuntime\n    participant Wallet as WalletProvider\n    participant Manager as RPCProviderManager\n    participant Providers as Provider Configs\n\n    Wallet->>Runtime: validateRPCProviderConfig()\n    Runtime-->>Wallet: {valid, providers, warnings}\n    Wallet->>Manager: initRPCProviderManager(runtime)\n    Manager->>Runtime: getSetting(\"EVM_RPC_PROVIDER\")\n    Runtime-->>Manager: preferred provider\n    Manager->>Runtime: getSetting(\"ALCHEMY_API_KEY\")\n    Manager->>Runtime: getSetting(\"INFURA_API_KEY\")\n    Manager->>Runtime: getSetting(\"ANKR_API_KEY\")\n    Manager->>Runtime: getSetting(\"ELIZAOS_CLOUD_*\")\n    Manager->>Providers: create configured providers\n    Providers-->>Manager: provider configs array\n    Manager->>Manager: sort by preference & chain coverage\n    Manager-->>Wallet: RPCProviderManager instance\n    \n    loop for each chain\n        Wallet->>Manager: resolveForChain(chainName)\n        Manager->>Runtime: check custom RPC (ETHEREUM_PROVIDER_*)\n        alt has custom RPC\n            Manager-->>Wallet: {providerName, rpcUrl, headers}\n        else no custom RPC\n            Manager->>Providers: find first provider supporting chain\n            Providers->>Providers: buildUrl(chainName, apiKey)\n            Providers-->>Manager: RPC URL\n            Manager-->>Wallet: {providerName, rpcUrl, headers}\n        end\n        Wallet->>Wallet: genChainFromName(chainName, rpcUrl)\n    end\n```\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
