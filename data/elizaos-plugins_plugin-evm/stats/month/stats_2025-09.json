      "author": "jonathanprozzi",
      "number": 16,
      "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nIn testing passing in calldata, we noticed that the `data` field was always `null` even though we were including it. When adding the changes to the `transferTemplate` to look for data, and also including it in the XML, we no longer saw it coming through as `null`. \r\n\r\nThe template now properly extracts and passes through any provided data/calldata, and the extended type guard in `transfer.ts` addresses an edge case where data was sometimes sent as `'null'` which didn't trigger the initial default to `0x`.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n### Template Updates\r\nAdded support for data/calldata in the transfer template by adding:\r\n- Instruction to extract \"Additional data/calldata (if any is included)\"\r\n- XML response field `<data>string | null</data>`\r\n\r\nPreviously,  the `TransferParams` interface supported an optional data parameter but it seemed that not being included in the template meant it was always `null`, even when provided in the request.\r\n\r\nThese changes enable proper handling of transaction data in transfers while protecting against LLM response variations. The template now properly extracts and passes through any provided data/calldata, and the code safely normalizes edge cases to ensure valid transaction data.\r\n\r\nThe `bun.lock` change is from a fresh install of the repo.\r\n\r\n**Note**: I tested this on version `1.0.6` but haven't been able to run `1.0.7` due to the character issue I filed on the main repo. Wanted to put up the PR in the meantime! Thank you -- greatly appreciate all the work ya'll are doing to transition!\r\n\r\n### Type Guard Change to Handle Edge Case\r\n\r\nAdded additional defensive handling in `TransferAction` for LLM response edge cases:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Normalize empty or invalid data field to '0x'\r\nif (!params.data || params.data === '0x') {\r\n  params.data = '0x';\r\n} else {\r\n  // Handle case where template returns 'null' string\r\n  params.data = (params.data as string) === 'null' ? '0x' : params.data;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis handles cases where the LLM returns 'null' as a string instead of a null value, ensuring the transaction data is always properly formatted.\r\n\r\n- `bun test` tests all pass:\r\n```\r\n 56 pass\r\n 0 fail\r\n```",
