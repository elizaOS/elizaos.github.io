The resolution of a key bug preventing plugin action callbacks from reaching users marks a major improvement in the platform's feedback loop. Community engagement drove discussions around future capabilities, including advanced DeFi functions and enhanced developer customizability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
