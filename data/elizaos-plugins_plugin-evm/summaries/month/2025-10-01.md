# elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm Monthly Report (October 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
October's development focused on foundational improvements and critical bug investigation. A significant effort was dedicated to diagnosing a complex import error affecting users of Eliza CLI v1.6.1, highlighting active collaboration between the community and the core team. Towards the end of the month, work began on two new initiatives: automating dependency management through Renovate and kicking off a new development stream with the "Spartan-Intel work."

## 🛠️ Key Developments
While no major features were merged, two important pull requests were opened, setting the stage for future work:

-   **Dependency Management Automation:** To streamline maintenance and keep dependencies current, a pull request ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/23)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration. This will help automate the process of updating project dependencies.
-   **New Feature Initiation:** A new development effort, referred to as "Spartan-Intel work," was initiated. The initial pull request ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/24)) marks the beginning of this new workstream for the plugin.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month was centered on a single, high-impact bug. No new issues were opened, and none were closed.

-   **New & Active Issues:** The primary focus was on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/6031), concerning import errors with Eliza CLI version 1.61. Contributor `matteo-brandolino` provided detailed diagnostics, suggesting the problem might stem from type definition files in `@Elizaos/core` v1.6.1. Team member `0xbbjoker` engaged in the discussion, attempting to reproduce the issue and suggesting the user upgrade to a newer CLI version as a temporary workaround while the team investigates further. The issue appears specific to version 1.6.1, as both older and newer versions work correctly.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The most notable collaboration this month occurred within the discussion on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/6031). The detailed bug report and follow-up diagnostics from community member `matteo-brandolino`, paired with the responsive troubleshooting from team member `0xbbjoker`, exemplifies a healthy and productive interaction between users and project maintainers. This collaborative effort was crucial in narrowing down the scope of a complex bug.
