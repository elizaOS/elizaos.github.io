# elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's efforts centered on improving project maintenance and addressing compatibility issues. A significant step was taken to automate dependency management with the introduction of a Renovate configuration. Concurrently, the team actively investigated a critical import error affecting users on a specific version of the Eliza CLI, with community discussion pointing towards a resolution involving the `@Elizaos/core` package.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on foundational maintenance rather than new features.

- **Dependency Management Automation**
  To streamline maintenance and keep dependencies current, a pull request ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/23)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration to the repository. This aims to automate the process of updating package dependencies, reducing manual overhead.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on a single, impactful compatibility problem.

- **Closed Issues:**
  There were no issues closed during this period.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  No new issues were opened. The primary focus was on the active issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/6031), concerning `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61`. Discussion on the issue suggests the problem originates from missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package version 1.6.1. It was noted that the issue is resolved by either downgrading to version 1.5.15 or upgrading to a version newer than 1.6.1.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the troubleshooting process for the active compatibility issue. Contributor `matteo-brandolino` provided key insights into the potential root cause of the import errors in issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/6031), demonstrating active community engagement in problem-solving.
