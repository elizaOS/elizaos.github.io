# elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on maintenance and collaborative problem-solving. A significant community-driven investigation successfully diagnosed a persistent import error related to `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1, identifying malformed type declaration files as the root cause. In parallel, work began to improve project maintenance by introducing a pull request to automate dependency management using Renovate. Overall, the week was characterized by a focus on stabilizing the development environment and improving long-term project health.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on improving the project's maintenance infrastructure.

- **Dependency Management Automation:** A new pull request, [#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/23), was opened to add a Renovate configuration. This aims to streamline and automate the process of keeping project dependencies up-to-date, reducing manual effort and ensuring security.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened and no existing issues were closed this week. The primary focus was on diagnosing a critical active issue.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - The main activity was a deep-dive investigation into issue **[#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/6031) - Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61**. Through collaborative discussion, the root cause was traced to missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) in the `@elizaos/core` package, version 1.6.1. The investigation concluded that the issue was not in `plugin-evm` but in the build process for that specific version of the core CLI. The recommended workaround for users is to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or a later version.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong community collaboration in debugging a complex issue.

- The discussion on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/6031) was a prime example of effective open-source problem-solving. Contributors **matteo-brandolino** and **claude** worked together to provide system details, analyze package contents, and ultimately pinpoint the exact cause of the import errors. Their detailed diagnosis not only provided a clear path forward for affected users but also offered valuable feedback for the core ElizaOS team regarding their release and validation processes.
