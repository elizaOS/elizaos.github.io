# elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm Weekly Report (Feb 8 - 14, 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week focused on a foundational transformation of the EVM plugin, shifting toward a more resilient and feature-complete architecture. The primary achievements included the implementation of a sophisticated multi-provider RPC abstraction and a total overhaul of the `EVMService`. By integrating with the Spartan-Intel chain registry and introducing robust wallet management and multicall capabilities, the plugin has significantly matured its ability to handle complex, cross-chain AI agent operations with improved reliability and performance.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### Infrastructure & RPC Resilience
To ensure high availability and broader chain coverage, the plugin now features a multi-provider RPC abstraction. This system allows agents to dynamically interface with various infrastructure providers, ensuring that the failure of a single service does not disrupt agent autonomy.
*   **Multi-Provider Support:** Integrated support for Alchemy, Infura, Ankr, and the Eliza Cloud proxy.
*   **Automatic Fallback:** Implemented logic to select preferred providers with automatic fallback mechanisms to maintain uptime ([#25](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/25)).

### EVMService Architecture Overhaul
The core `EVMService` was redesigned to serve as a comprehensive hub for blockchain interactions, moving beyond simple connectivity to a full-suite management layer.
*   **Chain Registry Integration:** Integrated with the Spartan-Intel chain registry for standardized chain data ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/24)).
*   **Wallet & Transaction Management:** Introduced robust key operations, including validation, signing, and transfer functionalities.
*   **Portfolio & DeFi Tools:** Added balance and portfolio management features, a DEX registry for decentralized exchange interactions, and multicall batching to optimize gas and execution speed ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/24)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
*   **Closed Issues:** No specific issues were closed during this period, as the focus remained on the large-scale architectural PRs that addressed internal technical debt and feature gaps.
*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported or reached the threshold for active discussion this week. The development cycle was dominated by the implementation of the core service overhauls.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The activity this week was characterized by high-impact, foundational contributions aimed at stabilizing the plugin's core. The primary work centered on merging significant pull requests ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/24), [#25](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/25)) that required deep integration with the existing framework. While the volume of individual PRs was low, the technical scope of the merged code indicates a concentrated effort by maintainers to establish a modular and extensible base for future contributors.
