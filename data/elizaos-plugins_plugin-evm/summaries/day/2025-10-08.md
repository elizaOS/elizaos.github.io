### Investigation into `@elizaos/core` Import Errors [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/6031)
Discussion continued regarding the "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61" issue. @matteo-brandolino confirmed using Arch Linux and provided system details (Node v24.9.0, Bun 1.2.22), responding to @wtfsayo's query about the operating system. This follows a detailed diagnosis by @claude on October 7th, which identified the root cause as missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, recommending an upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later. The issue is confirmed to be version-specific and not related to user environment or TypeScript configuration.
