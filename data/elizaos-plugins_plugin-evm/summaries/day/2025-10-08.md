### Investigation into Eliza CLI Import Errors [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/6031)
Discussion continued regarding the "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61" issue. User matteo-brandolino provided further details, including their OS (Arch Linux) and Node/Bun versions, and shared the output of `bun x tsc --noEmit` which showed numerous import errors related to `@elizaos/core`. The user also noted that the issue appears specific to version 1.6.1, with older and newer versions working correctly. The ElizaOS team member `0xbbjoker` suggested that the problem might be related to the IDE's TypeScript compiler and requested the user to try running `bun x tsc --noEmit` to confirm. `0xbbjoker` also mentioned that they could not reproduce the issue on a fresh install with version 1.6.1 and asked if matteo-brandolino could proceed with a newer CLI version while the team investigates.
