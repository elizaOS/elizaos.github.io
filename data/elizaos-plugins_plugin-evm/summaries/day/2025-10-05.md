## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/6031))**: Discussion continued regarding import errors when using Eliza CLI 1.61.
    - **matteo-brandolino** suggested the issue might be related to type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically `dist/index.d.ts` and `dist/types/index.d.ts` referencing a non-existent `src` directory. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem.
