### Troubleshooting Import Errors in Eliza CLI 1.6.1
Discussion continued on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/6031), which reports `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61`. The latest comment suggests the problem might stem from incorrect type definition files within the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing source files that are not included in the published package. It was noted that downgrading to version 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the issue, pointing to a potential bug specific to version 1.6.1.
