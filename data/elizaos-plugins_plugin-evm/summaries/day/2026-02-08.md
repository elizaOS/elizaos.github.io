# elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm Daily Update (Feb 8, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant enhancements to the EVM plugin, introducing multi-provider RPC support and integrating Spartan-Intel for expanded EVM service capabilities.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced RPC Provider Flexibility
A new feature was added to support multi-provider RPC abstraction, including Alchemy, Infura, Ankr, and Eliza Cloud. This allows for automatic fallback and selection of preferred providers, significantly improving reliability and coverage across various chains. ([#25](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/25))

### Spartan-Intel Integration and EVM Service Overhaul
The EVMService was overhauled to integrate with the Spartan-Intel chain registry. This integration introduces new functionalities such as wallet/key operations, validation/signing, balance/portfolio management, transfers, DEX registry, and multicall batching, alongside provider optimizations.
