## CLOSED ISSUES

### Agent Response and Callback Fixes
Several issues related to agent responses and plugin action callbacks were addressed and closed. This includes a fix for successive replies on target users ([#4940](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/4940)) and ensuring callbacks from plugin actions are properly delivered to the end-user response in chat ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5017)). The latter was confirmed to be working after updating to version 1.0.9.

### REST API Room Creation
The issue where creating a room via the REST API initially worked but then returned an empty rooms array ([#4955](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/4955)) was closed. This was confirmed to be resolved in version 1.0.9, with the understanding that agents register in rooms only after a message is sent, and the switch from rooms to channels.

### Bedrock Integration
The issue concerning the integration of Bedrock as an LLM ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5117)) was closed. A new plugin, `plugin-bedrock`, was released to address this.
