# elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm Daily Update (Sep 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the `plugin-evm` repository saw a new feature enabling optional data parameters in transfer templates and a routine dependency update. Several issues were closed, including fixes for CLI CI tests and UI enhancements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced EVM Transfer Functionality
A new feature was added to support an optional `data` parameter within the transfer template, addressing an issue where `calldata` was not being correctly passed. This improves the flexibility of EVM transfers. ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/16))

### Maintenance and Dependency Updates
The project underwent a routine maintenance update, bumping the version to 1.0.13 and updating various dependencies to ensure the plugin remains current and stable. ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/22))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### CLI and Dockerization Improvements
Several issues related to development environment and testing were resolved. This includes fixing CLI CI tests ([#5714](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5714)) and completing the dockerization of the `project-starter` ([#5842](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5842)).

### UI and AI Provider Integration Discussions
Discussions around UI enhancements, specifically showing action calls and results in the chat UI, led to the closure of an issue ([#5831](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5831)). Additionally, a feature request for Native Venice AI Provider Integration was addressed by pointing to existing solutions and a dedicated plugin ([#5820](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5820)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Feature: Native Venice AI Provider Integration ([#5820](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5820))
The latest comment from `wtfsayo` clarifies that privacy-focused AI provider integration can be achieved by modifying the base URL environment variable for the `plugin-openai` or by using the dedicated `plugin-venice`. This suggests that the requested feature might already be indirectly supported or has a dedicated solution outside of `plugin-evm`.
