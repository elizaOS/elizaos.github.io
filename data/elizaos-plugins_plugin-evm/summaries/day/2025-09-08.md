### Native Venice AI Provider Integration
Discussion on [#5820](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5820) regarding the integration of a native Venice AI provider suggests that users can achieve similar functionality by modifying the base URL environment variable for the `plugin-openai`.
