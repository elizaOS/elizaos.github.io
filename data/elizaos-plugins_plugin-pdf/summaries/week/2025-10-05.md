# elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were centered on addressing a critical build issue and improving long-term project maintenance. The primary focus was the investigation into a significant import error affecting users of Eliza CLI v1.6.1, which prevents the plugin from compiling due to missing exports in the `@elizaos/core` package. Community collaboration has been crucial in diagnosing this bug, with detailed reports helping to narrow down the cause. In parallel, work began to automate dependency management with the introduction of Renovate configuration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This week's development focused on improving the project's maintenance infrastructure.

- **Dependency Management Automation**
  - A new pull request, [#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf/pull/8), was opened to add a Renovate configuration file. This initiative aims to automate the process of keeping project dependencies up-to-date, reducing manual maintenance overhead and ensuring the plugin stays current with its ecosystem.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The issue tracker was dominated by the investigation of a single, high-impact bug.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - The main focus was on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf/issues/6031), a critical bug causing numerous `TS2305: Module '"@elizaos/core"' has no exported member` errors.
  - The problem appears to be specific to version 1.6.1 of the `@elizaos/core` package. User `matteo-brandolino` provided extensive diagnostic output and noted that downgrading to v1.5.15 or upgrading to a version newer than 1.6.1 resolves the issue, suggesting a problem with the published v1.6.1 package itself.
  - The investigation is ongoing, with contributors gathering more environmental context, such as the user's operating system (Arch Linux), to pinpoint the root cause.
