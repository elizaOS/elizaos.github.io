### Troubleshooting Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61
Discussion continued on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf/issues/6031), which reports "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61". Today, `matteo-brandolino` provided an update, confirming that the issue persists on an Arch Linux system and shared the output of `bun x tsc --noEmit`, which shows numerous `TS2305` errors indicating missing exported members from `@elizaos/core`. These errors include `logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, `Project`, `ProjectAgent`, `Character`, `UUID`, and various types related to plugins. The user noted that the problem does not occur with versions prior to 1.6.1 or with later versions, suggesting a version-specific bug. `0xbbjoker` previously suggested that the issue might be related to the IDE's TypeScript compiler, as they could not reproduce the problem on a fresh installation with 1.6.1.
