### Investigation into `@elizaos/core` Import Errors [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf/issues/6031)
The discussion on this issue continued with user `matteo-brandolino` confirming their operating system as Arch Linux, in response to `wtfsayo`'s query about the environment. This further clarifies the context for the reported import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.6.1. The issue remains active as the team investigates the root cause of the missing exports in that specific version of `@elizaos/core`.
