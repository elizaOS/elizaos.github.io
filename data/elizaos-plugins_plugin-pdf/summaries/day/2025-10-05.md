## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf/issues/6031))
The discussion on this issue continued with new insights from matteo-brandolino. The latest comment suggests that the problem might stem from type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically `dist/index.d.ts` and `dist/types/index.d.ts`, which appear to reference source files not included in the published package. This could explain why TypeScript is failing to find imports like `logger`, `Project`, or `IAgentRuntime`. It was noted that downgrading to `@Elizaos/core` version 1.5.15 resolves the issue, and versions newer than 1.6.1 also seem to work correctly, pointing to a potential bug specific to version 1.6.1. Previously, 0xbbjoker confirmed that the issue did not reproduce on their setup with version 1.6.1 and provided troubleshooting steps.
