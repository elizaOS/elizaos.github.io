### Addressing `@elizaos/core` Import Errors in Eliza CLI 1.61
Discussion continued on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf/issues/6031) regarding import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61. The user `matteo-brandolino` provided a detailed output of `bun x tsc --noEmit`, showing numerous `TS2305: Module '"@elizaos/core"' has no exported member` errors for various types and functions like `logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, `Project`, `Character`, `UUID`, `Plugin`, `Action`, `ActionResult`, `Content`, `GenerateTextParams`, `HandlerCallback`, `Memory`, `ModelType`, `Provider`, `ProviderResult`, `Service`, and `State`. Additionally, `TS2339` and `TS7006` errors related to `ZodError` and implicitly `any` typed parameters were reported in `plugin.ts`. `matteo-brandolino` suggested the issue might stem from missing source files in the published `@Elizaos/core` package for version 1.6.1, noting that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem. Previously, `0xbbjoker` had suggested running `bun x tsc --noEmit` to diagnose the issue, suspecting an IDE TSC compiler problem, as they could not reproduce the error on a fresh installation.
