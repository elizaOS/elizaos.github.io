# elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development activity focused on improving project maintenance and investigating a critical compatibility issue. The primary enhancement was the integration of Renovate to automate dependency updates, a key step towards long-term project health. Concurrently, significant effort was dedicated to diagnosing an import error affecting users of Eliza CLI 1.6.1, with investigations pointing towards a potential bug in the core framework.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This month's work centered on foundational maintenance to ensure the project's stability and ease of upkeep.

### Dependency Management Automation
- To improve long-term maintainability and ensure dependencies remain up-to-date, a Renovate configuration was added to the repository ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf/pull/8)). This automates the process of creating pull requests for dependency updates, reducing the manual maintenance burden on contributors.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed during this period. The focus remained on diagnosing a significant active issue.

### New & Active Issues
- No new issues were opened in October.
- Significant discussion continued on an active issue concerning import errors (`Module '"@Elizaos/core"' has no exported member 'logger'`) when using the plugin with Eliza CLI 1.6.1 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf/issues/6031)). The investigation suggests the root cause may be a bug in the type definition files of `@Elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, as the problem is reportedly resolved by using either older or newer versions of the core package. This issue represents a potential blocker for users on that specific version of the CLI.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was centered on troubleshooting. The active discussion on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf/issues/6031) highlighted community effort in diagnosing a complex bug, with contributors like `matteo-brandolino` and `0xbbjoker` working together to pinpoint the potential source of the problem within the `@Elizaos/core` package.
