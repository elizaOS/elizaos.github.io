      "body": "## Context\nDiscord plugin v1.3.4 failed to publish, resulting in a version jump from v1.3.3 directly to v1.3.5.\n\n- **Source**: Discord discussion (2026-01-03)\n- **Priority**: P1 (from issue-triage assessment)\n- **Impact**: Medium-High (breaks predictable upgrades; may strand users on bad versions)\n\n## Evidence\n- Discord: \"v1.3.4 failed to publish; version jumped from v1.3.3 to v1.3.5\"\n- Reporter: YogaFlame\n- Related: Previous issue #9 (v1.0.x getWavHeader) is different and closed\n- Pattern: Indicates release pipeline fragility\n\n## Technical Details\n- **Component**: Plugin System / Publishing pipeline (npm, registry, CI workflows)\n- **Complexity**: 3/5 (requires pipeline audit and safeguards)\n- **Required Expertise**: npm publishing, CI release workflows, semver/tagging\n\n## Proposed Investigation\n1. Audit npm error logs + CI run for v1.3.4 publish attempt\n2. Check for tag creation issues, provenance problems, npm token scope\n3. Determine if v1.3.4 contained important fixes that users need\n4. Add automated guard: fail if version already exists / missing changelog\n\n## Proposed Prevention\n1. Add \"release checklist\" to CI workflow\n2. Implement dry-run publish in CI before actual release\n3. Add Slack/Discord notification on publish failure\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Root cause of v1.3.4 failure documented\n- [ ] Release workflow improved to prevent recurrence\n- [ ] Process documented for handling skipped versions\n\n---\nGenerated from [elizaOS intelligence pipeline](https://github.com/elizaOS/knowledge)\nEvidence date: 2026-01-06",

      "author": "standujar",
      "number": 41,
      "body": "<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>\n\n### Greptile Summary\n\nThis PR updates the Discord plugin to use the new `handleMessage` method instead of the deprecated `sendMessage` method in the elizaOS unified messaging API. The changes are clean and complete:\n\n- Updated the `UnifiedMessagingAPI` interface definition to use `handleMessage`\n- Updated the runtime check function `hasUnifiedMessagingAPI` to detect the new method\n- Updated the actual API call in `messages.ts` to invoke `handleMessage`\n- Updated documentation comments to reflect the new method name\n\nThe PR also includes formatting changes (single to double quotes) that appear to be from an auto-formatter. All changes are backward compatible since they only affect the new unified API path, with fallbacks to `messageService` and event-based handling still intact.\n\n### Confidence Score: 5/5\n\n- This PR is safe to merge with no risk - it's a straightforward method rename that aligns with the updated elizaOS API\n- The changes are minimal, focused, and complete. All three required updates (interface definition, runtime check, and API call) are present and correct. The PR maintains backward compatibility through existing fallback mechanisms for older core versions. No logic changes were introduced, only a method name update.\n- No files require special attention\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\nFile Analysis\n\n\n\n| Filename | Score | Overview |\n|----------|-------|----------|\n| src/messages.ts | 5/5 | Updated unified API call from `sendMessage` to `handleMessage` at line 455, aligning with the new interface definition |\n| src/utils.ts | 5/5 | Updated `UnifiedMessagingAPI` interface and `hasUnifiedMessagingAPI` function to use `handleMessage` instead of deprecated `sendMessage`, includes formatting changes (quote style) |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Discord as Discord Message\n    participant MM as MessageManager\n    participant Utils as getUnifiedMessagingAPI()\n    participant Runtime as IAgentRuntime\n    participant UnifiedAPI as elizaOS.handleMessage\n    participant MsgService as messageService.handleMessage\n    participant Callback as HandlerCallback\n    \n    Discord->>MM: handleMessage(message)\n    MM->>MM: processMessage()\n    MM->>MM: buildMemoryFromMessage()\n    MM->>Utils: getUnifiedMessagingAPI(runtime)\n    Utils->>Runtime: Check elizaOS.handleMessage exists\n    \n    alt Unified API Available (NEW)\n        Runtime-->>Utils: elizaOS.handleMessage found\n        Utils-->>MM: Return UnifiedMessagingAPI\n        MM->>UnifiedAPI: handleMessage(agentId, message, {onResponse: callback})\n        UnifiedAPI->>Callback: Execute callback with content\n        Callback->>Discord: Send response to channel\n    else MessageService Available\n        Runtime-->>Utils: messageService found\n        Utils-->>MM: Return null, check messageService\n        MM->>MsgService: handleMessage(runtime, message, callback)\n        MsgService->>Callback: Execute callback with content\n        Callback->>Discord: Send response to channel\n    else Legacy Event-based\n        Runtime-->>Utils: Neither available\n        Utils-->>MM: Return null\n        MM->>Runtime: emitEvent(MESSAGE_RECEIVED)\n        Runtime->>Callback: Execute callback with content\n        Callback->>Discord: Send response to channel\n    end\n```\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **Refactor**\n  * Refined the unified messaging interface to a new public API surface, improving consistency of message handling.\n* **Chores**\n  * Bumped package version to 1.3.7.\n\n<sub>✏️ Tip: You can customize this high-level summary in your review settings.</sub>\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
