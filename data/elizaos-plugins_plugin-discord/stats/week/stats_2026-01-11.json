Key changes include:\n\n- **New DiscordService methods**: `buildMemoryFromMessage`, `setVoiceChannelStatus`, `clearActivity`, `setListeningActivity` enable voice channel status updates and bot activity management\n- **Public API exposure**: `buildStandardizedRooms` and `buildStandardizedUsers` methods made public for multi-bot clientRegistry access\n- **Enhanced attachment support**: Added base64 data URL and local file path handling in messages.ts for sending images/files from memory\n- **Message update utility**: New `update-message.ts` utility and `updateLastMessage()` method enable editing previously sent messages\n- **Type safety fixes**: Added null checks before `isDiscordSnowflake()` calls in joinChannel, sendDM, and setVoiceChannelStatus actions\n- **Build configuration**: Added `*.d.ts` to .gitignore and improved tsconfig.build.json settings\n\n**Critical security concern**: The new local file path handling (lines 297-301, 340-344 in messages.ts) reads files without path validation, creating a path traversal vulnerability if `media.url` comes from untrusted sources.\n\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\n\n\n- PR has path traversal vulnerabilities in attachment handling that need fixing before merge\n- Score reflects two critical path traversal issues in messages.ts where local file paths are read without validation (lines 297-301, 340-344). While the rest of the changes are solid improvements with proper null checks and clean implementations, these security vulnerabilities prevent a higher score. The type fixes, new utility functions, and API additions are well-implemented.\n- messages.ts requires immediate attention for path traversal vulnerabilities in local file attachment handling\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| src/service.ts | Major refactor: adds public buildStandardizedRooms/Users methods, voiceConnectionManager property, and new service methods (buildMemoryFromMessage, setVoiceChannelStatus, clearActivity, setListeningActivity). Removes multi-bot infrastructure for simpler single-client approach. |\n| src/messages.ts | Adds base64 data URL and local file path handling for attachments, adds updateLastMessage() method with lastSentMessages tracking. Removes progressive message tracking system. |\n| src/update-message.ts | New utility file for updating Discord messages with proper event emission. Clean implementation with good error handling. |\n| src/actions/joinChannel.ts | Adds null check for messageServerId before isDiscordSnowflake check, fixing potential undefined access bug. Minor formatting cleanup. |\n| src/actions/sendDM.ts | Adds null check for messageServerId before isDiscordSnowflake check, preventing potential undefined access. |\n| src/actions/setVoiceChannelStatus.ts | Adds null check for messageServerId before isDiscordSnowflake check. Minor formatting cleanup. |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant DiscordAPI as Discord API\n    participant Service as DiscordService\n    participant MessageMgr as MessageManager\n    participant UpdateUtil as update-message.ts\n    participant Runtime as AgentRuntime\n    \n    Note over Service: Initialization\n    Service->>Service: Constructor creates client\n    Service->>MessageMgr: new MessageManager(this)\n    Service->>Service: voiceConnectionManager (optional)\n    Service->>DiscordAPI: client.login()\n    DiscordAPI-->>Service: ClientReady event\n    Service->>Service: onReady() - buildStandardizedRooms/Users\n    \n    Note over User,Runtime: Message Flow\n    User->>DiscordAPI: Send message\n    DiscordAPI->>Service: messageCreate event\n    Service->>MessageMgr: handleMessage()\n    MessageMgr->>MessageMgr: Process attachments (base64/local files)\n    MessageMgr->>Runtime: messageService.handleMessage()\n    Runtime-->>MessageMgr: callback with content\n    MessageMgr->>MessageMgr: Handle base64/local file attachments\n    MessageMgr->>DiscordAPI: send message chunks\n    DiscordAPI-->>MessageMgr: Discord messages\n    MessageMgr->>MessageMgr: Store in lastSentMessages Map\n    MessageMgr->>Runtime: createMemory()\n    \n    Note over MessageMgr,UpdateUtil: Message Update Flow\n    Runtime->>MessageMgr: updateLastMessage(roomId, content)\n    MessageMgr->>MessageMgr: Get from lastSentMessages Map\n    MessageMgr->>UpdateUtil: updateDiscordMessages()\n    UpdateUtil->>DiscordAPI: message.edit() for each chunk\n    UpdateUtil->>Runtime: emitEvent(MESSAGE_UPDATED)\n    \n    Note over Service,DiscordAPI: Voice/Activity Methods\n    Runtime->>Service: setVoiceChannelStatus(channelId, status)\n    Service->>DiscordAPI: channel.setStatus()\n    Runtime->>Service: setListeningActivity(text)\n    Service->>DiscordAPI: client.user.setActivity()\n    Runtime->>Service: clearActivity()\n    Service->>DiscordAPI: client.user.setActivity(null)\n```\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
