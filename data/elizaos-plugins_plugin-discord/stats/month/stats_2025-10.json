Review `mentionContext` collection in `src/messages.ts` (search for \"mentionContext\")\r\n2. Review strict mode implementation in `src/messages.ts` (search for \"shouldRespondOnlyToMentions\")\r\n3. Run test suite to verify coverage\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n**Automated Tests:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Discord plugin tests (17 tests)\r\nbun test __tests__/messageManager.test.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Test Coverage:**\r\n- ✅ `__tests__/messageManager.test.ts`\r\n  - Updated all existing tests to work with mentionContext\r\n  - Added 13 new tests in 3 groups:\r\n    1. **mentionContext metadata tests (5 tests)**\r\n       - Direct @mention sets isMention=true\r\n       - Reply to bot sets isReply=true\r\n       - Thread participation sets isThread=true\r\n       - Regular message has all false\r\n       - mentionType is correctly categorized\r\n    2. **Strict mode tests (4 tests)**\r\n       - Processes DMs in strict mode\r\n       - Processes @mentions in strict mode\r\n       - Processes replies to bot in strict mode\r\n       - Ignores regular messages in strict mode\r\n    3. **Natural mode tests (3 tests)**\r\n       - Processes all message types in natural mode\r\n       - Adds mentionContext to all messages\r\n       - Lets LLM decide based on context\r\n  - **Result: 17 pass, 0 fail**\r\n\r\n**Manual Testing (Discord Bot):**\r\n\r\n1. **Test strict mode** (`DISCORD_SHOULD_RESPOND_ONLY_TO_MENTIONS=true`):\r\n   ```\r\n   ✅ @BotName hello          → Should respond (platform mention)\r\n   ✅ Reply to bot's message  → Should respond (reply to bot)\r\n   ✅ DM to bot               → Should respond (DM)\r\n   ❌ Hey BotName, help me    → Should NOT respond (text mention ignored in strict mode)\r\n   ❌ BotName is cool         → Should NOT respond (reference ignored)\r\n   ❌ Reply to user message   → Should NOT respond (not a reply to bot)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. **Test natural mode** (default, no strict mode):\r\n   ```\r\n   ✅ @BotName hello               → Should respond (platform mention)\r\n   ✅ Hey BotName, help me         → Should respond (LLM detects direct address)\r\n   ✅ BotNamee can you help?       → Should respond (LLM handles typos)\r\n   ✅ Where is BotName?            → Should respond (LLM detects indirect question)\r\n   ❌ I talked to BotName yesterday → Should NOT respond (LLM detects past reference)\r\n   ❌ BotName's code is great      → Should NOT respond (LLM detects possessive reference)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nN/A - This is backend message processing with no UI changes\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites:**\r\n- ⚠️ **Wait for eliza core v1.6.2 release** (with MentionContext interface)\r\n- This PR uses `@elizaos/core: ^1.5.15` which will automatically pick up v1.6.x\r\n\r\n**Breaking change migration:**\r\n- Users wanting strict mention-only mode should use `DISCORD_SHOULD_RESPOND_ONLY_TO_MENTIONS=true`\r\n- Users wanting natural text mention detection should use default mode (no setting needed)\r\n\r\n**No database changes required**\r\n\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* New Features\n  * New Discord settings: ignore bot messages, ignore DMs, respond only to mentions.\n  * Smarter message handling with mention context (mentions, replies, threads) for stricter or natural modes.\n  * Ability to fetch eligible text-channel members with caching for large servers.\n* Bug Fixes\n  * Safer handling when channel type is missing and clearer validation errors.\n  * More consistent and informative error logging.\n* Tests\n  * Expanded coverage for mentions, replies, threads, DMs, and audio attachments.\n* Chores\n  * Version bump to 1.3.0 and dependency updates.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
