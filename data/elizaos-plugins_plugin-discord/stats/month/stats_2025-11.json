      "author": "standujar",
      "number": 24,
      "body": "<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copying and pasting relevant items out of the HTML comments. -->\r\n\r\n# Relates to\r\n\r\nRelates to elizaOS/eliza#6095 and https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6111 - Unified messaging API\r\n\r\nWe have to wait https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6111 to be merged and released 1.6.4 a least before merging this one.\r\n\r\nDepends on: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6111\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n**Low risk**\r\n\r\nThis change is non-breaking and fully backward compatible:\r\n- Uses unified API when available via `runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage()`\r\n- Falls back to `messageService.handleMessage()` for standalone mode\r\n- Includes logging to track which path is used\r\n- Well-tested with live Discord bot\r\n\r\nPotential areas affected:\r\n- Message processing flow (now uses unified API)\r\n- Discord message handling (improved error handling and cleanup)\r\n- Service initialization (cleaner code, removed unnecessary wrapper)\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates the new unified messaging API (`elizaOS.sendMessage()`) from elizaOS/eliza#6095, allowing the Discord plugin to use the standardized messaging entry point.\r\n\r\n**Key changes:**\r\n- **messages.ts**: Refactored `handleMessage()` to use `elizaOS.sendMessage()` when available\r\n- Added fallback to `messageService.handleMessage()` for standalone mode\r\n- Added debug logging to track which messaging path is used\r\n- **service.ts**: Cleaned up Discord client initialization and improved error handling\r\n- Updated `@elizaos/core` dependency to `^1.6.4`\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n- Standardized messaging across all platforms\r\n- Automatic field auto-filling (id, agentId, createdAt)\r\n- Better connection management via `ensureConnection`\r\n- Support for SYNC/ASYNC modes with callbacks\r\n- Reduced code duplication\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- [x] Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Improvements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n- [x] Updates (new versions of included code)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this?\r\n\r\nThe unified messaging API provides a single, standardized entry point for all message processing. Instead of each plugin calling `messageService.handleMessage()` directly, they can now use `elizaOS.sendMessage()` which provides:\r\n\r\n- Auto-filling of required fields\r\n- Connection verification before processing\r\n- Support for SYNC/ASYNC modes\r\n- Consistent error handling\r\n- Better observability\r\n\r\nThis improves maintainability and ensures all platforms benefit from future enhancements to the unified API.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the main change: `src/messages.ts` lines 331-345 - unified API integration\r\n2. Check service improvements: `src/service.ts` - cleaner initialization\r\n3. Verify logging: Debug logs show which path is used\r\n4. Check dependencies: `package.json` - updated core version\r\n\r\n**Test scenario:**\r\n```\r\nUser: @Bot What's up?\r\nBot: Fine, and you ?\r\n```\r\n\r\nLogs show:\r\n```\r\nInfo [Discord] Using unified messaging API\r\nInfo [MessageService] Message received from <user> in room <room>\r\nDebug [MessageService] Processing message: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n1. Ensure `@elizaos/core` is updated to `^1.6.4` or later (includes unified API runtime reference)\r\n2. Rebuild plugin: `bun run build`\r\n3. Standard deployment process\r\n\r\n## Special note\r\n\r\nLater we will remove the fallback and clean many lines of code on discord-plugin\r\n\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **New Features**\n  * Channel management: allow/disallow channels and view allowed channel list.\n  * Fetch text channel members with optional caching.\n\n* **Improvements**\n  * Unified messaging path used when available, with fallback to previous path.\n  * More robust connection and message handling with clearer logging.\n\n* **Chores**\n  * Bumped version to 1.3.3.\n  * Updated core dependency to a newer compatible release.\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
