Instead of each plugin calling `messageService.handleMessage()` directly, they can now use `elizaOS.sendMessage()` which provides:\r\n\r\n- Auto-filling of required fields\r\n- Connection verification before processing\r\n- Support for SYNC/ASYNC modes\r\n- Consistent error handling\r\n- Better observability\r\n\r\nThis improves maintainability and ensures all platforms benefit from future enhancements to the unified API.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the main change: `src/messages.ts` lines 331-345 - unified API integration\r\n2. Check service improvements: `src/service.ts` - cleaner initialization\r\n3. Verify logging: Debug logs show which path is used\r\n4. Check dependencies: `package.json` - updated core version\r\n\r\n**Test scenario:**\r\n```\r\nUser: @Bot What's up?\r\nBot: Fine, and you ?\r\n```\r\n\r\nLogs show:\r\n```\r\nInfo [Discord] Using unified messaging API\r\nInfo [MessageService] Message received from <user> in room <room>\r\nDebug [MessageService] Processing message: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n1. Ensure `@elizaos/core` is updated to `^1.6.4` or later (includes unified API runtime reference)\r\n2. Rebuild plugin: `bun run build`\r\n3. Standard deployment process\r\n\r\n## Special note\r\n\r\nLater we will remove the fallback and clean many lines of code on discord-plugin\r\n\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **New Features**\n  * Channel management: allow/disallow channels and view allowed channel list.\n  * Fetch text channel members with optional caching.\n\n* **Improvements**\n  * Unified messaging path used when available, with fallback to previous path.\n  * More robust connection and message handling with clearer logging.\n\n* **Chores**\n  * Bumped version to 1.3.3.\n  * Updated core dependency to a newer compatible release.\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
