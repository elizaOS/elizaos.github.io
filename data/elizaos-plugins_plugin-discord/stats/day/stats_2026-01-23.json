The change is minimal, focused, and preserves all existing functionality while fixing the private field access bug. The formatting changes are cosmetic improvements that increase code consistency.\n- No files require special attention\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| src/compat.ts | Fixed proxy method binding to preserve `this` context for private field access, preventing \"Cannot access invalid private field\" errors when runtime methods access private fields like `#conversationLength` |\n| package.json | Version bump from 1.3.7 to 1.3.8 for patch release |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client as Plugin Code\n    participant Proxy as createCompatRuntime Proxy\n    participant Target as AgentRuntime\n    participant PrivateField as #conversationLength\n\n    Note over Client,PrivateField: Before Fix: Method calls lose context\n    Client->>Proxy: runtime.getConversationLength()\n    Proxy->>Proxy: get trap intercepts access\n    Proxy->>Target: Reflect.get(target, 'getConversationLength', receiver)\n    Note over Proxy: Returns unbound function<br/>with this = proxy\n    Proxy-->>Client: Returns unbound function\n    Client->>Proxy: Call function\n    Proxy->>PrivateField: Try to access #conversationLength\n    PrivateField-->>Proxy: ❌ Error: Cannot access invalid private field\n    \n    Note over Client,PrivateField: After Fix: Methods bound to target\n    Client->>Proxy: runtime.getConversationLength()\n    Proxy->>Proxy: get trap intercepts access\n    Proxy->>Target: Reflect.get(target, 'getConversationLength', receiver)\n    Proxy->>Proxy: value.bind(target)\n    Note over Proxy: Binds this = target (AgentRuntime)\n    Proxy-->>Client: Returns bound function\n    Client->>Target: Call bound function\n    Target->>PrivateField: Access #conversationLength\n    PrivateField-->>Target: ✅ Returns conversation length\n    Target-->>Client: Returns value\n```\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
