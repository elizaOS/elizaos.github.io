      "body": "## Context\nDiscord plugin v1.3.4 failed to publish, resulting in a version jump from v1.3.3 directly to v1.3.5.\n\n- **Source**: Discord discussion (2026-01-03)\n- **Priority**: P1 (from issue-triage assessment)\n- **Impact**: Medium-High (breaks predictable upgrades; may strand users on bad versions)\n\n## Evidence\n- Discord: \"v1.3.4 failed to publish; version jumped from v1.3.3 to v1.3.5\"\n- Reporter: YogaFlame\n- Related: Previous issue #9 (v1.0.x getWavHeader) is different and closed\n- Pattern: Indicates release pipeline fragility\n\n## Technical Details\n- **Component**: Plugin System / Publishing pipeline (npm, registry, CI workflows)\n- **Complexity**: 3/5 (requires pipeline audit and safeguards)\n- **Required Expertise**: npm publishing, CI release workflows, semver/tagging\n\n## Proposed Investigation\n1. Audit npm error logs + CI run for v1.3.4 publish attempt\n2. Check for tag creation issues, provenance problems, npm token scope\n3. Determine if v1.3.4 contained important fixes that users need\n4. Add automated guard: fail if version already exists / missing changelog\n\n## Proposed Prevention\n1. Add \"release checklist\" to CI workflow\n2. Implement dry-run publish in CI before actual release\n3. Add Slack/Discord notification on publish failure\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Root cause of v1.3.4 failure documented\n- [ ] Release workflow improved to prevent recurrence\n- [ ] Process documented for handling skipped versions\n\n---\nGenerated from [elizaOS intelligence pipeline](https://github.com/elizaOS/knowledge)\nEvidence date: 2026-01-06",
