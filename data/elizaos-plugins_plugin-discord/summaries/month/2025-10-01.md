# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Monthly Report (October 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
October was a month of significant modernization and stabilization for the Discord plugin. Development focused heavily on refactoring core message handling to align with the latest ElizaOS core interfaces, culminating in a migration to `runtime.handleMessage()`. This foundational work was complemented by the introduction of new user-facing features like slash commands. The team and community also collaborated effectively to diagnose and resolve two critical CLI-related bugs that impacted user installations, demonstrating a responsive and healthy development cycle.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
This month's efforts centered on enhancing the plugin's architecture, fixing critical bugs, and introducing new functionality.

- **Modernization of Message Handling**
  A series of related pull requests progressively improved how the plugin processes Discord messages. The effort began with adding support for message embeds, forwards, and referenced message context ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/17)). This was followed by a major refactor to adopt the new `MentionContext` interface, improving character name detection ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/19)). The work culminated in the migration to use the core `runtime.handleMessage()` function, a key step in aligning the plugin with the broader ElizaOS framework ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/21)).

- **New User-Facing Features**
  Towards the end of the month, work began on enhancing the plugin's interactivity within Discord. A new pull request ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/23)) was opened to introduce slash commands, improve modal interactions, and fix attachment handling, paving the way for a richer user experience.

- **Critical Bug Fixes**
  A runtime error caused by a null `DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS` setting was resolved, ensuring the plugin can initialize correctly even with a minimal configuration ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/22)).

- **Repository Maintenance**
  To streamline dependency management and improve long-term maintainability, a Renovate configuration was added to the repository to automate dependency updates ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/20)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month was characterized by rapid responses to critical user-facing bugs related to the ElizaOS CLI.

- **Closed Issues:**
  A critical bug ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6088)) that prevented the ElizaOS CLI from finding the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` module was reported and swiftly resolved. The release of CLI version 1.6.3 fixed the issue, with users confirming the solution.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  The most significant discussion occurred around issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6031), which concerned import errors when using Eliza CLI v1.61. Community members provided detailed analysis, correctly identifying the root cause as a build/publish pipeline issue with missing type definition files in that specific version of `@elizaos/core`. The recommended solution was for users to upgrade to a newer version of the CLI, highlighting a potential need for publish-time validation in the core project.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community collaboration was instrumental in troubleshooting key issues this month. The detailed investigation by users in issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6031) was crucial in pinpointing a bug within the core CLI package. Similarly, the quick reporting and confirmation of the fix for the module resolution bug in [#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6088) demonstrated a tight feedback loop between users and maintainers, leading to the rapid release of a patched CLI version. This active engagement is a strong indicator of a healthy and invested community.
