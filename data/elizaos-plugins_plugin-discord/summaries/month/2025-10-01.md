# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month of significant refinement for the Discord plugin, focusing on enhancing message processing capabilities and improving long-term code health. Development centered on enabling the plugin to understand richer message context, including embeds and message forwards. A major refactoring effort was completed to align with an upcoming `MentionContext` interface from the core ElizaOS framework. Additionally, repository maintenance was automated with the integration of Renovate, while the team actively investigated a critical dependency issue related to Eliza CLI.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on improving how the agent processes and understands Discord communications, alongside foundational maintenance improvements.

-   **Enhanced Message Processing and Context:**
    A series of updates improved the plugin's ability to parse complex messages. Initial work expanded message processing to include support for embed titles and descriptions, as well as context from referenced (replied-to) messages ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/17)). This was followed by a significant refactoring of the codebase to adopt a new `MentionContext` interface, which resolves issues with fuzzy matching for character name detection and aligns the plugin with upcoming changes in the Eliza core framework ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/19)).

-   **Dependency Management Automation:**
    To improve repository maintenance and security, a Renovate configuration was added ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/20)). This will automate the process of keeping project dependencies up-to-date, reducing manual effort and ensuring the plugin remains current with the latest packages.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed during this period, but a significant external dependency issue was under investigation.

-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in this timeframe.
-   **New & Active Issues:** The primary focus was on investigating issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6031), concerning import errors when using Eliza CLI version 1.6.1. The investigation suggests the root cause is a bug within the `@Elizaos/core` package (v1.6.1), which appears to be missing necessary type definition files in its published version. This presents a potential blocker for users on that specific version, with the current workaround being to downgrade to v1.5.15 or upgrade to a version newer than 1.6.1.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident through close coordination with the core ElizaOS team. The refactoring for the `MentionContext` interface ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/19)) was dependent on a feature branch in the main Eliza repository, highlighting tight integration between the plugin and the core framework's development. Additionally, the active discussion and diagnosis on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6031) demonstrates contributor engagement in troubleshooting and resolving ecosystem-wide challenges.
