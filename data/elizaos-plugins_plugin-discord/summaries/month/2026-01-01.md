# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Monthly Report (January 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
In January, development focused on stabilizing the Discord plugin's release pipeline and aligning its architecture with the broader ElizaOS ecosystem. The primary challenge involved diagnosing a critical publishing failure that caused versioning inconsistencies between v1.3.3 and v1.3.5. Concurrently, the project made strides in modularity by resolving long-standing issues with slash command extensibility and initiating a transition toward the ElizaOS unified API.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### API Standardization & Integration
Efforts began to bring the Discord plugin in line with the ElizaOS unified API standards. 
*   **Unified API Transition:** A significant pull request, [#41](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/41), was introduced to transition the plugin from using `sendMessage` to the standardized `handleMessage` method. This change is critical for ensuring cross-plugin compatibility within the ElizaOS framework.

### Infrastructure & CI/CD Stability
A major portion of technical analysis was dedicated to the plugin's distribution pipeline following failed attempts to publish versions v1.3.4 and v1.3.6.
*   **Build Failure Analysis:** Investigation into failed GitHub Action runs (specifically runs 58802573225 and 20466870500) identified persistent TypeScript errors in `src/service.ts`. These errors were linked to type constraints and event handling, specifically involving `EventPayloadMap` and `DiscordRegisterCommandsPayload`.
*   **Dependency Review:** Maintainers began reviewing `package.json` dependencies, specifically `@elizaos/config` (1.6.5) and `@elizaos/core` (^1.7.0), to ensure they are not contributing to the current build failures.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
*   **Slash Command Extensibility:** The team resolved a significant usability issue regarding missing join and leave commands [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/15). Rather than simply hardcoding the missing commands, the system was refactored to be extensible, allowing developers to dynamically add slash commands as required by their specific agent implementations.

### New & Active Issues
*   **Critical Publishing Failure ([#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/40)):** This remains the highest priority (P1) active issue. The jump from v1.3.3 to v1.3.5, and the subsequent failure of v1.3.6, represents a medium-high impact blocker for the project's release cycle. The core of the discussion revolves around resolving incompatible types for event handlers that are preventing successful NPM publication.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The month was characterized by deep technical troubleshooting among maintainers. The activity surrounding issue [#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/40) shows a high degree of collaborative debugging, with contributors diving into specific CI/CD run logs and type definitions to identify root causes. The resolution of the slash command issue [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/15) also reflects a commitment to the project's core philosophy of modularity, opting for a flexible developer-centric solution over a quick fix.
