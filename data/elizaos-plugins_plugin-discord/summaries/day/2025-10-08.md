## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Critical Bug Fix for Discord Channel ID Handling
A runtime error occurring during the initialization of the Discord plugin, specifically when processing `DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS`, was resolved. This fix prevents the application from crashing by adding a null check before attempting to trim the channel IDs string, ensuring robust handling of potentially undefined settings. ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/22))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Feature: Migrate to `runtime.handleMessage()`**: A new pull request, [#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/21), was opened to migrate the Discord plugin to use `runtime.handleMessage()`. This is currently a Work In Progress (WIP).

### Discussion on `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1 Import Errors ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6031))
The discussion around import errors in `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1 continued with significant input. @matteo-brandolino confirmed the issue persists on Arch Linux and provided system details (Node v24.9.0, Bun 1.2.22). Claude, an AI agent, provided a detailed diagnosis, identifying the root cause as missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1 specifically. Claude's analysis suggests that while the exports exist in the source code, they were not properly exposed in the published package's `.d.ts` files due to an incomplete build or failed declaration generation. Recommendations include upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later, and for the ElizaOS team, considering deprecating v1.6.1 and implementing publish-time validation. This confirms the issue is version-specific and not environment-dependent.
