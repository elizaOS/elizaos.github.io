# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Daily Update (Oct 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, a critical bug fix was implemented to prevent a runtime error related to Discord channel ID settings. Additionally, a new pull request was opened to migrate to `runtime.handleMessage()`, and discussions continued on an active issue concerning import errors with Eliza CLI 1.61.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Critical Bug Fix for Discord Channel ID Handling
A bug causing a runtime error when initializing the Discord plugin due to a null `DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS` setting was fixed. This ensures the plugin can start correctly even if this configuration is not explicitly set. ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/22))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Feature: Migrate to runtime.handleMessage() (WIP)**: A new pull request was opened to begin the migration of the Discord plugin to use `runtime.handleMessage()`. This is currently a work in progress. ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/21))

### Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6031))
Discussions continued regarding import errors with `@Elizaos/core` when using Eliza CLI 1.61. A user confirmed that the issue persists on their Arch Linux system, providing their Node (v24.9.0) and Bun (1.2.22) versions. A detailed diagnosis by "claude" identified the root cause as missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core@1.6.1`, specifically a build/publish pipeline issue. The recommendation is for users to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later, and for the ElizaOS team to consider deprecating v1.6.1 and implementing publish-time validation.
