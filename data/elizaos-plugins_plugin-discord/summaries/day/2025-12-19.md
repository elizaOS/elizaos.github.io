# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in Discord bot functionality with the introduction of a tiered permission system for invite URLs and enhanced slash command permissions, alongside discussions on extending JSON API endpoints.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Discord Bot Permissions and Invite System
- A new tiered permission system for Discord bot invite URLs was implemented, featuring a 3x2 matrix of role levels (Basic, Moderator, Admin) and voice options (With Voice, Without Voice). This involved adding a centralized `permissions.ts` file and enhancing the banner. ([#33](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/33))
- Hybrid slash-command permissions were added, incorporating Discord permissions, channel-whitelist bypass, and custom validators. This also included a safer command registration pipeline and fixes for DM channel handling. ([#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/29))

### Discussion on JSON API Endpoints for Summaries
- Issue [#185](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/185) discusses extending the static JSON API to include summary endpoints.
- The refined approach, based on data engineering feedback, proposes generating JSON alongside markdown during the `summarize` command, rather than as a separate export step.
- Key design decisions include generating JSON alongside markdown, allowing full export due to manageable data volume, and retaining `export-summaries` as a backfill tool.
- The proposed `SummaryAPIResponse` shape includes version, type, interval, date, generation timestamps, content format, and a content hash for change detection.
- Endpoints are planned for dated files (overall, repos, contributors) and "latest" pointers, with index files starting with overall.
- Implementation changes involve modifying existing summary generation files to write JSON, adding `apiHelpers.ts` for utilities like `sha256`, `buildSummaryResponse`, `writeLatestPointer`, and `updateIndex`.
- The rationale for this approach is to keep JSON artifacts in sync with markdown and the database, avoid extra workflow steps, enable efficient client-side caching, and provide an upgrade path for incremental export.
- A comment from `madjin` further refines the approach by suggesting extending `fsHelpers.ts` instead of creating a new `apiHelpers.ts` and adding types inline or to existing files to keep things DRY. It also highlights the need for `sha256()`, `getContributorSummaryFilePath()`, `getAPIFilePath()`, `writeLatestPointer()`, `updateIndex()`, and specific type definitions.
