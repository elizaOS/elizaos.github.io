# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Daily Update (Oct 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a significant code refactoring to integrate a new `MentionContext` interface, impacting core service and message handling files.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Refactoring for MentionContext
A major refactoring effort was completed to adopt the new `MentionContext` interface, which is dependent on a feature branch in the Eliza core. This change addresses previous issues with fuzzy matching for character name detection within the Discord plugin. The refactoring involved updates to `src/service.ts`, `src/messages.ts`, and `src/environment.ts`, along with corresponding test files.
