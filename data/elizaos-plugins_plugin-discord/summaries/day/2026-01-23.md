# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Daily Update (Jan 23, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a critical bug fix addressing proxy method binding within the `plugin-discord` to ensure proper access to private fields.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Proxy Method Binding Fix
A significant bug was resolved where proxy methods were not correctly bound to their target, leading to issues with accessing private fields like `#conversationLength`. This fix ensures that `this` is correctly set to the original `AgentRuntime` when `createCompatRuntime` wraps it in a Proxy, preventing "Cannot acc" errors.
