# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Daily Update (Jan 23, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a critical bug fix related to proxy methods and private field access within the `plugin-discord` runtime, ensuring proper functionality.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Runtime Compatibility Fixes
- Addressed an issue where proxy methods were not correctly binding to the target, leading to `this` being set to the proxy instead of the original `AgentRuntime`. This fix resolves problems with accessing private fields like `#conversationLength`. ([#45](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/45))
