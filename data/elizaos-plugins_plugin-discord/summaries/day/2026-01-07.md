## NEW ISSUES

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Publishing Failure Investigation
Discussion continued on issue [#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/40) regarding the failure to publish version v1.3.4. The latest comments indicate that v1.3.6 was attempted for publication, but no corresponding action was observed. Analysis of past publishing failures on December 23rd revealed TypeScript errors related to `EventPayloadMap` and `DiscordRegisterCommandsPayload`, suggesting compatibility issues with `elizaos/config` 1.6.5 and `elizaos/^1.7.0`.
