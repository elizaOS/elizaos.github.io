A new issue, [#6364](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6364), was opened, reporting a "Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' - UPDATE_CONTACT requires entity initialization". The issue details that `UPDATE_CONTACT` fails because `ensureConnection()` is not called before saving facts, leading to "No ownership data found for world" logs.
