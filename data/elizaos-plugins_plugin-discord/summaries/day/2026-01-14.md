## NEW ISSUES

A new issue, [#6364](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6364), was opened, reporting that the "Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' - UPDATE_CONTACT requires entity initialization." The issue details that `UPDATE_CONTACT` fails because `ensureConnection()` is not called before saving facts, leading to "No ownership data found for world" messages. A proposed fix involves a modification within `reflection.ts` before `UPDATE_CONT`.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Reflection Evaluator Failure
Issue [#6364](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6364) highlights a critical bug where the reflection evaluator fails due to an "Entity not found" error when `UPDATE_CONTACT` is called. The root cause is identified as `ensureConnection()` not being invoked prior to saving facts. The latest comment from "thewoweffect" expresses appreciation for the team's work.
