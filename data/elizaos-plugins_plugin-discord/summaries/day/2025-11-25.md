# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Daily Update (Nov 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on improving the robustness of Discord command registration by ensuring continued operation even if individual registrations fail. A new issue was opened regarding OpenAI-compatible API integration.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Discord Command Registration Reliability
A critical bug fix was implemented to improve the resilience of Discord slash command registration. The system will now continue processing the registration queue even if one command's registration encounters an error, logging the failure and throwing it only after the entire queue has been processed. This prevents a single faulty command from halting all subsequent registrations. ([#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/26))

## NEW ISSUES
### Request for OpenAI-Compatible API Integration
A new issue was opened requesting the addition of an option to use OpenAI-compatible APIs, allowing users to specify a custom API host and key, rather than being limited to OpenRouter. ([#6168](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6168))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### OpenAI-Compatible API Integration Discussion
Discussion on [#6168](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6168) began with a user requesting the ability to use OpenAI-compatible APIs with custom hosts and API keys. A clarifying question was posed by @standujar, asking if the user was referring to the `plugin-openai` repository, suggesting a potential misunderstanding or a need to redirect the request.
