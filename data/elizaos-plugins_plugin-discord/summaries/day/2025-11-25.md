# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Daily Update (Nov 25, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the robustness of Discord command registration by implementing a fix that allows the process to continue even if individual command registrations fail. A new issue was also opened regarding the integration of OpenAI-compatible APIs.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Discord Command Registration Reliability
A fix was implemented to ensure that the Discord slash command registration queue continues processing even if a specific command registration encounters an error. This improves the resilience of the command deployment process by logging failures and proceeding with subsequent registrations. ([#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/26))
