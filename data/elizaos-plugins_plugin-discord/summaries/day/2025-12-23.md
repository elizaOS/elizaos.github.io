# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Daily Update (Dec 23, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes for TypeScript type errors and significant refactoring of message handling. Enhancements were also made to the permission system and server/message fallback handling.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### TypeScript Type Error Resolution & Event Handling
Several TypeScript type errors were resolved, particularly concerning typed event handlers. This included adding a `DiscordRegisterCommandsPayload` interface and using generic types for `registerEvent` to improve type safety and consistency across the service. The `useModel` transcription call was also fixed to correctly pass `Buffer` instead of `File`. ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/38))

### Message Handling Refinements
A substantial refactoring effort was undertaken to update message handling mechanisms. This involved removing an unused development dependency and making numerous changes across various action files to streamline message processing. ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32))

### Permission System and Fallback Handling Enhancements
The plugin received an updated permission system and improved server/message fallback handling. This included implementing fast-path emoji extraction, explicit-request detection, and LLM fallback for reactions, alongside refined emoji normalization. ([#34](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/34))
