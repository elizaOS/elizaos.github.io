# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Daily Update (Dec 23, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes for TypeScript type errors, significant refactoring of message handling, and enhancements to the permission system and server/message fallback mechanisms.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### TypeScript Type Error Resolution & Event Handling
Resolved several TypeScript type errors across various modules, particularly in event handling and model transcription calls. This included adding a new interface for Discord command registration payloads and ensuring correct type usage in `registerEvent` and `useModel` calls. ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/38))

### Message Handling Refactoring and Dependency Cleanup
Updated message handling logic and removed an unused development dependency, streamlining the codebase and preparing for future integrations. This refactoring touched numerous files related to actions, attachments, and service utilities. ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32))

### Permission System and Fallback Handling Enhancements
Introduced a new permission system and improved server/message fallback handling. This work also included refinements to reaction processing, such as fast-path emoji extraction, explicit-request detection, and LLM fallback for reactions. ([#34](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/34))
