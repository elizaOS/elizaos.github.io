## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Publishing Failure Analysis and Root Cause Identification
Discussion on [#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/40) indicates that version 1.3.6 was also attempted for publication without success. The last confirmed successful NPM publish was v1.3.3. Analysis of past failed publish runs (specifically run 58802573225 for PR #32 and run 20466870500 for PR #38) reveals consistent TypeScript errors related to event handling and type constraints within `src/service.ts`. The current `package.json` dependencies on `elizaos/config` (1.6.5) and `elizaos/^1.7.0` are also being reviewed as potential contributing factors.
