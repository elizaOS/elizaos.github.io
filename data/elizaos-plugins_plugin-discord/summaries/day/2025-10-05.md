## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6031))
Discussion continued regarding import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61. User matteo-brandolino suggested that the issue might stem from missing source files referenced by type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically in version 1.6.1. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem, indicating a potential bug specific to that version. This follows an earlier comment from 0xbbjoker who requested the user to try running `bun x tsc --noEmit` to diagnose if it's an IDE-specific issue, as they could not reproduce it on a fresh installation.
