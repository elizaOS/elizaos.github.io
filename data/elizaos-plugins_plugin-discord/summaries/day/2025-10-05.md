### Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.6.1 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6031))
Discussion continued on the issue where imports like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` are not found in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.6.1. The latest comment suggests the problem might stem from type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically `dist/index.d.ts` and `dist/types/index.d.ts`, referencing a `src` directory that is missing in the installed package. It was noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 seems to resolve the issue, pointing to a potential bug specific to version 1.6.1 of `@Elizaos/core`.
