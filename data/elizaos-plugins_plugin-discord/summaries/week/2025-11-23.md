# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Weekly Report (Nov 23 - 29, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing the plugin's internal quality and reliability. A key bug fix was implemented to make Discord command registration more robust, preventing a single failure from halting the entire process. Efforts also went into improving code maintainability through cleanup and better commenting. A significant new feature request was opened, sparking discussion around expanding API support to include any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, which could broaden the plugin's integration capabilities.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on foundational improvements to the codebase for better stability and developer experience.

- **Enhanced Command Registration Reliability**
  A critical bug fix in PR [#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/26) improved the resilience of Discord slash command registration. The system now logs errors for individual command registration failures but continues processing the rest of the queue, ensuring that one faulty command does not disrupt all others.

- **Codebase Refinements**
  To improve maintainability, dead code was removed and clarifying comments were added to the Discord service. This refactoring effort in PR [#28](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/28) enhances code clarity without introducing any functional changes.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was characterized by a significant new feature request, while a new pull request for structured logging ([#27](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/27)) was also opened.

- **Closed Issues:**
  No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  The most notable new issue is [#6168](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6168), which requests the ability to use any OpenAI-compatible API, not just OpenRouter. This would allow users to specify a custom API host and key. Discussion on the issue began with a maintainer clarifying if the request was intended for a different repository (`plugin-openai`), indicating active triage and cross-project awareness.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was visible in the active triage of new community-submitted issues. The discussion on issue [#6168](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6168) between a user and maintainer @standujar highlights direct engagement with feature requests and a collaborative effort to clarify requirements.
