# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Weekly Report (Nov 16 - 22, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development focused on significantly enhancing the plugin's core communication and interaction capabilities. A major highlight was the integration of a unified messaging API, aligning the plugin with broader ElizaOS framework standards for communication. Additionally, substantial improvements were made to Discord-specific features, including bug fixes for slash commands, modal interactions, and attachment handling, making the agent's interactions more robust and reliable.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on two key areas: integrating a new messaging standard and refining existing Discord interactions.

- **Unified Messaging API Integration**
  A new feature was merged to integrate the unified messaging API, a crucial step towards standardizing communication across the ElizaOS ecosystem ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/24)). This work, which impacts core service and message handling files, directly relates to the ongoing effort in the main ElizaOS repository (elizaOS/eliza#6095).

- **Discord Interaction and Attachment Enhancements**
  A significant bug fix was implemented to improve the plugin's handling of Discord's native features ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/23)). This update addresses issues with slash commands, modal interactions, and attachment handling, enabling dynamic command registration and the ability to send attachments in DMs and channels. In a related effort, a new pull request was opened to prevent the plugin from sending empty messages, further refining message processing ([#25](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/25)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The issue tracker remained quiet during this period, with development focused on implementing changes via pull requests.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no notable discussions on existing active issues.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
While the daily reports did not highlight specific community discussions, the work completed shows clear collaboration with the core ElizaOS framework. The integration of the unified messaging API ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/24)) is directly linked to a pull request in the main `elizaOS/eliza` repository, indicating close coordination between the plugin and core development teams.
