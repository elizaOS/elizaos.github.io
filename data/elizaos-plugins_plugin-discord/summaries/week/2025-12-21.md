# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Weekly Report (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing the plugin's stability and maintainability through significant refactoring and bug fixes. Key efforts included resolving critical TypeScript type errors, overhauling message handling logic, and introducing a new permission system. Alongside this foundational work, a substantial number of new issues were opened, signaling a strong future focus on improving the agent builder's UI/UX and overall user experience.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Development work centered on improving code quality, system architecture, and documentation.

- **Bug Fixes & Type Safety:** A series of TypeScript type errors were resolved across event handling, model transcription calls, and various service modules, improving overall code stability. This included adding a new interface for Discord command registration payloads to ensure type correctness ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/38), [#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/37)). A fix was also proposed to replace the deprecated `serverId` with `messageServerId` ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/39)).

- **Refactoring & System Enhancements:** Message handling logic was significantly updated, and an unused dependency was removed to streamline the codebase ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)). A new permission system was introduced alongside improved server and message fallback handling. This effort also refined reaction processing with fast-path emoji extraction and better LLM fallback logic ([#34](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/34)).

- **Architectural & Documentation Improvements:** A proposal for a new multi-bot voice architecture was submitted, aiming to support audio channels and progressive updates ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/36)). To improve code clarity for future development, docstrings were added to the `odi-spider` component, specifically in `reactToMessage.ts` and `banner.ts` ([#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/35)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week, but a large volume of new issues were opened, outlining a clear roadmap for upcoming user-facing improvements.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Agent Builder UI/UX:** A major focus of new issues was the agent builder, with numerous requests for UI/UX refinements. These include repositioning the avatar button ([#6273](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6273)), ensuring button consistency ([#6274](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6274)), adding an "unsaved changes" warning ([#6275](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6275)), and other enhancements like tooltips and inline send buttons ([#6270](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6270), [#6271](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6271)).
    - **User Experience & Performance:** Issues were raised concerning a long wait time for account recovery ([#6267](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6267)) and the smoothness of agent responses ([#6269](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6269)).
    - **Feature Requests:** Two new feature requests became immediately active: one for summarizing chat names ([#6278](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6278)) and another to add a user feedback button ([#6280](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6280)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
While there were no reports of high-discussion threads, a notable trend was the immediate engagement of AI tooling on new feature requests. For both the "Chat Renaming" ([#6278](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6278)) and "Add feedback button" ([#6280](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6280)) issues, CodeRabbit AI auto-generated initial plans, demonstrating an automated workflow to accelerate the development process from issue creation to implementation planning. The influx of detailed UI/UX issues on a single day suggests a coordinated feedback or testing session occurred.
