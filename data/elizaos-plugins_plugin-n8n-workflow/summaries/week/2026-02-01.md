# elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow Weekly Report (Feb 1 - 7, 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week focused on maturing the integration between ElizaOS and n8n, specifically targeting workflow reliability and cloud compatibility. Key achievements include the implementation of a multi-step loop control system that allows for user confirmation of draft workflows, alongside critical fixes for credential injection and action status reporting. The project also began expanding its functional scope with new capabilities for modifying existing workflows and validating output schemas, ensuring the plugin can handle more complex, iterative automation tasks.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### Workflow Control & Cloud Integration
Significant effort was directed toward ensuring the plugin operates reliably in cloud environments and handles complex logic gracefully.
*   **Multi-Step Loop Management:** Introduced an `awaitingUserInput` flag to pause cloud multi-step loops, preventing auto-confirmation and allowing users to review draft workflows before execution ([#13](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/13)).
*   **Context & Status Accuracy:** Updated `buildConversationContext` to utilize `recentMessages` for better state management and implemented explicit `success: true/false` reporting in action callbacks to prevent the ElizaOS core from misreporting failed actions as successful ([#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/11), [#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/12)).

### Reliability & Credential Management
Refinements were made to how the plugin identifies intents and handles sensitive data.
*   **Credential Injection:** Fixed issues with credential injection using fuzzy API suffix matching and corrected LLM prompt examples to improve accuracy ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/8)).
*   **Intent Classification:** Improved classification logic using language-agnostic structural rules to enhance reliability across different user inputs ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/8)).

### Feature Expansion & CI/CD
The plugin's capabilities were extended while maintaining a robust deployment pipeline.
*   **Workflow Modification:** Initiated work on a new feature to allow the modification of existing n8n workflows and the validation of output schemas ([#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/14)).
*   **Pipeline Optimization:** Added a mandatory `bun run crawl-nodes` step to the `npm-deploy.yml` workflow to ensure all n8n nodes are correctly indexed before building, accompanied by version bumps to 1.0.9 ([#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/10)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### Active Issues
*   **Prompt Engineering & Logic Syncing:** A significant discussion is ongoing regarding Eliza's character files and prompt overhead. Contributors are exploring moving away from "prose-based" instructions toward logic-based synchronization (referencing the BotNode.io blueprint and MAE-1.0) to avoid the "Biological Trap" of excessive prompt engineering ([#6447](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/issues/6447)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week's activity shows a strong focus on technical refinement and architectural discussions. Collaboration is evident in the rapid iteration of the CI/CD pipeline and the integration of feedback regarding cloud UI behavior. The community is currently engaged in high-level architectural debates (Issue [#6447](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/issues/6447)) that suggest a shift toward more structured, logic-driven agent interactions rather than relying solely on natural language prompts.
