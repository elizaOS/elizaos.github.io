# elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow Monthly Report (February 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
February focused on maturing the integration between ElizaOS and n8n, transitioning from basic connectivity to robust, production-ready workflow management. Key achievements included the implementation of human-in-the-loop controls for multi-step operations and significant enhancements to cloud compatibility. The project also prioritized reliability through improved intent classification and more accurate action status reporting, ensuring the framework can handle complex automation tasks with greater autonomy and precision.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### Workflow Control & Human-in-the-Loop
A major advancement this month was the introduction of more granular control over automated processes.
*   **Multi-Step Loops:** Introduced the `awaitingUserInput` flag, allowing the system to pause for user confirmation after creating a draft workflow. This prevents unintended auto-execution of complex logic ([#13](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/13)).
*   **Workflow Modification:** Initiated work on the ability to modify existing n8n workflows and validate output schemas, expanding the plugin's utility beyond simple creation ([#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/14)).

### Cloud Integration & Reliability
Several updates were deployed to ensure seamless operation within cloud environments and better synchronization with the ElizaOS core.
*   **Context Handling:** Updated `buildConversationContext` to utilize `state.values.recentMessages`, ensuring the agent maintains accurate situational awareness in cloud deployments ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/12)).
*   **Status Reporting:** Fixed a critical bug where failed actions were incorrectly reported as successful in the UI. All action callbacks now explicitly return a `success` status ([#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/11)).
*   **Credential Management:** Enhanced credential injection using fuzzy API suffix matching and language-agnostic structural rules for intent classification ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/8)).

### CI/CD & Maintenance
The development pipeline was refined to ensure build consistency and versioning accuracy.
*   **Build Pipeline:** Added a mandatory `bun run crawl-nodes` step to the `npm-deploy.yml` workflow to ensure all n8n nodes are correctly indexed before publishing ([#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/10)).
*   **Versioning:** The package progressed through versions 1.0.7 to 1.0.9 to reflect reliability fixes and CI improvements ([#9](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/9), [#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/10)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### New & Active Issues
*   **Prompt Engineering & Logic:** A significant discussion is ongoing regarding the "Biological Trap" of over-relying on prose-based prompt engineering. Contributors are advocating for a shift toward logic-based synchronization between agents, referencing the BotNode.io blueprint and MAE-1.0 for future optimization ([#6447](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/issues/6447)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The month saw active technical discourse regarding the fundamental architecture of AI agents. The community is moving beyond simple bug fixing toward high-level architectural alignment, specifically focusing on how agents should communicate via structured logic rather than natural language prompts. Collaboration between contributors like Renator13 has been instrumental in identifying these long-term optimization paths for the ElizaOS ecosystem.
