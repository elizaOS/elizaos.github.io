# elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow Daily Update (Feb 10, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing workflow management with the addition of a new action for modifying existing n8n workflows and implementing output schema validation. A version bump to 1.1.0 was also completed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Workflow Management and Validation
A significant feature was introduced allowing the modification of existing n8n workflows. This enables loading deployed workflows for editing and then using the `CREATE_N8N_WORKFLOW` action to apply changes and redeploy. Additionally, output schema validation was implemented to ensure that `$json.field` expressions correctly reference existing fields, improving workflow reliability and error handling ([#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/14)).

### Version Update
The project version was bumped from 1.0.12 to 1.1.0, reflecting the new features including workflow modification, schema validation, and improvements to output schemas and parameter correction ([#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/15)).
