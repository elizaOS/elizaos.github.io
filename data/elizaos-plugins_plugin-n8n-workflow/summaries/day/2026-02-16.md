# elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow Daily Update (Feb 16, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the `plugin-n8n-workflow` by adding REST API routes for comprehensive workflow management, enabling direct frontend interaction without the NLP pipeline.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Workflow Management API
- Implemented REST API routes to facilitate CRUD operations for workflows, node catalog browsing, validation, and execution monitoring, bypassing the agent NLP pipeline. ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16))
- Introduced new files for API routes, services, and types to support the new functionality. ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16))

### Testing Infrastructure Updates
- Added new unit tests for the `executions`, `nodes`, `validation`, and `workflows` routes to ensure the reliability of the new API endpoints. ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16))
- Included an end-to-end test for `routes-workflows` to validate the complete workflow management process. ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16))
