## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a critical bug fix related to property visibility checks in workflows. This ensures that default property values are correctly applied before visibility is determined, preventing issues when structural fields are omitted by the LLM.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Workflow Property Visibility Fix
A bug was addressed where property defaults were not applied before visibility checks, leading to incorrect visibility determinations when structural fields were omitted. This fix ensures that `isPropertyVisible` correctly considers default values for fields like `resource`, `operation`, and `language`, resolving issues with dependent fields.
