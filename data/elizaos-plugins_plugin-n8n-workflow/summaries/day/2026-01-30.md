# elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow Daily Update (Jan 30, 2026)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on enhancing workflow creation with a new draft/preview/confirm flow, improving user interaction, and refining callback mechanisms.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Workflow Creation and Management
*   Implemented a new draft/preview/confirm flow for `CREATE_N8N_WORKFLOW`, replacing one-shot deployment with a state machine for generating, previewing, confirming/modifying/canceling, and deploying workflows. This includes caching states for better user control [#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/5).
*   Introduced LLM-driven intent classification to guide the draft process [#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/5).
*   Added support for pending workflow drafts, allowing users to confirm or modify before final deployment [#7](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/7).

### Callback and Credential Store Improvements
*   Addressed and fixed issues related to callbacks in the workflow creation process [#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/6).
*   Integrated a credential store to manage n8n credentials securely [#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/5).
