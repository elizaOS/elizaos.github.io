## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Eliza Character File & Prompt Engineering**
    *   Discussion centers on improving Eliza's character file and prompts based on initial testing feedback.
    *   A key observation from Renator13 suggests that prompt engineering overhead is a symptom of the "Biological Trap" and advocates for agents to sync via logic rather than prose, referencing MAE-1.0 and the BotNode.io blueprint for optimization.
