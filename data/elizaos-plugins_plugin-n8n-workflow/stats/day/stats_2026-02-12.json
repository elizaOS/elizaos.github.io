      "title": "Add REST API routes for workflow management",
      "author": "standujar",
      "number": 16,
      "body": "## Summary\nExpose REST API routes from `plugin-n8n-workflow` to enable direct frontend access for workflow CRUD, node catalog browsing, validation, and execution monitoring — without going through the agent NLP pipeline.\n\nThis creates a dual-access architecture:\n- **Agent access**: NLP → actions (existing)\n- **Frontend access**: REST → routes (new)\n\n## Routes Added\n### Workflows\n- `GET /workflows` - List workflows for a user\n- `POST /workflows` - Create workflow with auto credential resolution\n- `GET /workflows/:id` - Get workflow details\n- `PUT /workflows/:id` - Update existing workflow\n- `DELETE /workflows/:id` - Delete workflow\n- `POST /workflows/:id/activate` - Activate workflow\n- `POST /workflows/:id/deactivate` - Deactivate workflow\n\n### Validation\n- `POST /workflows/validate` - Real-time workflow validation (nodes, parameters, inputs)\n\n### Nodes\n- `GET /nodes?q=...` - Search node catalog with relevance scoring\n- `GET /nodes/available` - Browse categorized catalog (supported/unsupported/utility)\n- `GET /nodes/:type` - Get node definition\n\n### Executions\n- `GET /executions` - List executions with filters (workflowId, status, limit, cursor)\n- `GET /executions/:id` - Get execution details\n\n## Implementation Details\n- **Route handlers** delegate to service layer (no business logic in handlers)\n- **Credential resolution** via existing `N8nCredentialBridge` (OAuth/API key mapping)\n- **Auto-positioning** nodes for workflow creation/updates\n- **ElizaOS integration**: Runtime auto-collects `plugin.routes` and prefixes with plugin name\n\n## Changes\n- Add route handlers in `src/routes/` (workflows, nodes, validation, executions)\n- Export `routes: n8nRoutes` from plugin (auto-collected by ElizaOS runtime)\n- Add `listByUser()` to `N8nCredentialStoreApi` for credential mapping\n- Add `getWorkflow()` and `listExecutions()` to `N8nWorkflowService`\n- Add `getAllNodes()` to catalog utils\n- Update mock service helper with new methods\n\n## Tests\n✅ **37 unit tests** across 4 files, 78 assertions, all passing:\n- `validation.test.ts` - 5 tests (valid/invalid workflows, missing fields)\n- `nodes.test.ts` - 8 tests (search, catalog, filtering, 404/400 errors)\n- `workflows.test.ts` - 16 tests (full CRUD, activation, validation, missing credentials)\n- `executions.test.ts` - 8 tests (list, filters, detail, errors)\n\n## Next Steps\n- [ ] Add e2e tests for Next.js catch-all route integration\n- [ ] Add retry execution endpoint (`POST /executions/:id/retry`)\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **New Features**\n  * Exposed REST API endpoints for workflow management (create, read, update, delete, activate, and deactivate operations)\n  * Added execution listing and detail retrieval endpoints with filtering support\n  * Integrated node catalog API with search and availability filtering\n  * Added workflow validation endpoint with detailed error reporting\n\n* **Tests**\n  * Comprehensive test coverage for all new API routes\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",

      "author": "standujar",
      "number": 17,
      "body": "## Summary\nRename crawl scripts to better reflect their purpose and reduce ambiguity in the data pipeline.\n\n## Changes\n### Script Renames\n- `crawl-schemas.ts` → `crawl-output-schemas.ts`\n  - Extracts output schemas from `__schema__/` directories in n8n-nodes-base\n  - Generates `schemaIndex.json` with 457+ node output schemas\n\n- `capture-trigger-schemas.ts` → `crawl-triggers-live.ts`\n  - Captures trigger schemas from **live n8n executions**\n  - Requires `N8N_HOST` + `N8N_API_KEY` environment variables\n  - Generates `triggerSchemaIndex.json`\n\n- `crawl-trigger-schemas.ts` → `crawl-triggers-static.ts`\n  - Extracts trigger schemas from **code + OpenAPI specs** (alternative method)\n  - No live n8n instance required\n\n### Documentation Updates\n- Update README.md with new script names\n- Update npm script `crawl:schemas` → runs `crawl-output-schemas.ts`\n- Update error messages and usage comments in scripts\n- Update crawl.ts orchestrator to use new names\n\n### Version Bump\n- `1.1.0` → `1.2.0` (minor version for refactor)\n\n## Benefits\n✅ **Clearer purpose**: Script names now describe what they do, not how  \n✅ **Easier onboarding**: New contributors can understand the pipeline at a glance  \n✅ **Consistent naming**: All crawl scripts follow `crawl-*` pattern  \n✅ **Reduced ambiguity**: \"schemas\" could mean input/output/trigger — now explicit\n\n## Testing\nNo functional changes — renames only. Existing crawl functionality is preserved.\n\n## Notes\n- This PR will conflict with #16 (REST API routes) which accidentally included these renames. We can resolve by accepting this PR's renames and removing them from #16.\n- The `langchain-output-schemas.json` data update is also included (new schemas from latest crawl)\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n## Release Notes\n\n* **Documentation**\n  * Updated README to reflect reorganized data generation workflow with clearer script naming conventions.\n  * Improved trigger schema capture documentation.\n\n* **New Features**\n  * Added alternative static trigger schema extraction method from code and OpenAPI specs.\n\n* **Chores**\n  * Version bump to 1.2.0.\n  * Updated internal script references and configuration mappings.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
