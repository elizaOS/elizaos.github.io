      "author": "standujar",
      "number": 8,
      "body": "## Summary\n- **Fix credential injection**: fuzzy Api suffix matching in credentialResolver + correct LLM prompt examples (`gmailOAuth2Api` → `gmailOAuth2`)\n- **Fix intent classification**: language-agnostic structural rules instead of keyword-based matching — short confirmations like \"creer le\" no longer misclassify as \"new\"\n- **Fix DELETE/ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE**: fetch workflows directly from service instead of relying on `state.data.workflows` (provider data not reliably merged into state by ElizaOS)\n- **Fix settings access**: use `runtime.character.settings.workflows` instead of `runtime.getSetting()` which only returns primitives\n- **Auto-activate workflows** after deployment via `POST /workflows/{id}/activate`\n- **Remove LIST_N8N_WORKFLOWS action**: `activeWorkflowsProvider` already injects workflow list into LLM context (bootstrap plugin pattern)\n- **Add safety net** in CREATE \"new\" path: restore draft if generation fails\n- **Rename settings key** from `n8n` to `workflows`\n- **Update node catalog** via new `crawl-nodes` script\n- **Cloud bridge credential_data flow**: plugin creates n8n credentials from OAuth tokens/API keys provided by cloud bridge, caches mapping in credential store\n- **Integration availability check** (spec 09): three-tier pre-generation check — immediate block when no service nodes remain, LLM feasibility assessment when partial coverage exists, proceed when all integrations are available. Prevents generating workflows the platform can't run\n- **Conversation context preservation**: `buildConversationContext` passes last 5 messages to generation, preventing context loss after errors or multi-turn interactions\n- **Constrain generation to catalog**: LLM prompt now enforces strict usage of provided node types only\n\n## Test plan\n- [x] 159 tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)\n- [ ] Live test: create workflow → verify credentials injected + auto-activated\n- [ ] Live test: delete workflow by ID or name\n- [ ] Live test: confirm short messages (\"go\", \"oui\") classify as confirm, not new\n- [ ] Live test: create workflow with unsupported integrations → UNSUPPORTED_INTEGRATION response\n- [ ] Live test: create workflow with partially supported integrations → feasibility check proceeds or blocks\n- [ ] Live test: confirm draft with missing credentials → AUTH_REQUIRED with auth URLs\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n## Release Notes\n\n* **New Features**\n  * Workflow modification: modify existing drafts without full regeneration\n  * Execution history: view workflow run history and status details\n  * Enhanced credential handling: automatic detection and authentication flow for missing credentials\n  * Improved workflow matching: identify workflows by name or semantic description\n\n* **Bug Fixes**\n  * Draft lifecycle management and recovery after generation failures\n  * Credential resolution priority and caching\n  * Workflow matching accuracy\n\n* **Documentation**\n  * Comprehensive architecture and specification guide\n  * Updated prompts for better intent classification supporting multiple languages\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
