# elizaos/auto.fun Daily Update (Jul 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The primary focus today was on addressing compatibility issues with the Bun build process, specifically by initiating a migration from Pino to Adze for logging. A new issue regarding the Autofun smart contract's outdated base was also opened.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Logger Compatibility for Bun Builds
An effort was initiated to replace the Pino logger with Adze to resolve `pino-pretty` errors encountered during Bun export builds. This migration aims to ensure compatibility with Bun's binary compilation process, maintaining the existing logging API and features. The task is code-complete and awaiting `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build` verification. ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5673))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Pino to Adze Logger Migration ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5673))
The discussion on this issue centers around the ongoing migration from the Pino logger to Adze to resolve `pino-pretty` compatibility issues with Bun's binary compilation. The latest comment from "claude" indicates that the code migration is complete. The `ElizaLogger` class has been rewritten using Adze while maintaining a pino-compatible API, ensuring zero breaking changes for the 182 files that use the logger. Key features like custom log levels, `InMemoryDestination`, environment variable configuration, Sentry integration, and agent context binding have been preserved. The next steps involve running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build` to fully verify the migration.
