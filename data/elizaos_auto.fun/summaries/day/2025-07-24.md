## NEW ISSUES

*   **Smart Contract Review**
    A new issue was opened to discuss the autofun smart contract, noting that it is based on an older version of the Pumpfun smart contract and lacks a global vault, storing SOL directly on the bonding curve like tokens. [#521](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/521)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Logger Compatibility for Bun Builds**
    Discussion on [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5673) centered around replacing `pino` with `adze` to resolve `pino-pretty` errors in export builds from Bun. A detailed plan for migration was outlined, including analyzing current `pino` usage, researching `adze` API, updating dependencies, implementing an `InMemoryDestination` equivalent, creating an `adze`-based logger with a `pino`-compatible API, maintaining custom log levels, preserving environment variable configuration, and updating server API logging endpoints. The migration is code-complete, with core changes involving replacing `pino` and `pino-pretty` with `adze` and creating an `ElizaLogger` class that wraps `adze` with a `pino`-compatible API, ensuring zero breaking changes. The next steps involve running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build` to verify the migration.
