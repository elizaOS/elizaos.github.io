## NEW ISSUES

*   **Smart Contract Outdated Base**
    A new issue was opened highlighting that the autofun smart contract is based on an old version of the Pumpfun smart contract, specifically noting the absence of a global vault in the newer version where SOL is stored directly on the bonding curve. ([#521](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/521))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Logger Compatibility with Bun Builds**
    Discussion on [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5673) indicates a successful migration from `pino` to `adze` to resolve `pino-pretty` errors in export builds from Bun. The `claude` bot has completed the task, creating a branch (`claude/issue-5673-20250724-0444`) and a draft PR. The migration involved replacing `pino` and `pino-pretty` dependencies with `adze`, implementing an `ElizaLogger` class with a pino-compatible API, and preserving all existing logging functionality, including custom log levels, memory buffering, and environment configuration. The next steps involve running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build` to fully verify the changes.
