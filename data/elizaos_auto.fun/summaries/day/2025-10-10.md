### Clarifying `agent.generate` API for Text Generation
Discussion on [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5923) centered on defining the `agent.generate` API. @tylermcwilliams inquired whether `generate()` is intended for text generation only or for all model types. @0xbbjoker clarified that it should be `generateText` for text generation and `generateImage` for image generation, suggesting a more specific naming convention. @tylermcwilliams then proposed a `generateText(input: string, options?: GenerateTextOptions)` signature, including options for character personality and model type, and offered to implement it.
