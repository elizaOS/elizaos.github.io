# elizaos/auto.fun Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development efforts centered on foundational API design and clarification. The primary focus was on defining a clear and extensible structure for the agent's generation capabilities. Key discussions resulted in a proposal for a more modular API, separating text and image generation functions to better align with our core philosophy of composability. This groundwork sets the stage for future implementation of more diverse and specialized agent skills.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, there were no major code changes or merged pull requests documented this month. The development work was concentrated in the planning and discussion phase, particularly around API specifications.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month was focused on clarifying future development paths rather than resolving existing bugs.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed in October.

- **New & Active Issues:** The most significant activity occurred within issue [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5923), which addressed the scope of the `agent.generate` API. The discussion evolved from a general query into a concrete design proposal. The consensus moved towards replacing a generic `generate()` method with more specific functions like `generateText` and `generateImage`. A proposed signature for `generateText(input: string, options?: GenerateTextOptions)` was put forward, laying a clear path for implementation.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active discussion on API design. The dialogue on issue [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5923) between contributors @tylermcwilliams and @0xbbjoker exemplifies the project's collaborative spirit. The interaction showcased a productive feedback loop, moving from an initial question to a refined, community-vetted proposal that one of the members then volunteered to implement.
