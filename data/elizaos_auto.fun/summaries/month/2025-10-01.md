# elizaos/auto.fun Monthly Report (October 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
October's development efforts centered on foundational API design for agent capabilities. The primary focus was on clarifying the scope and implementation of the agent generation interface, ensuring a clear and extensible structure for future features. This led to a key discussion that refined the approach for handling different types of generative tasks, such as text and image creation, setting the stage for upcoming implementation work.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
While no major features were merged this month, significant progress was made in the planning and design phase of the agent API. The work focused on defining clear and specific function signatures ahead of implementation.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month was focused on proactive API design discussions rather than bug fixes.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in this period.
- **New & Active Issues:** The most significant activity occurred within issue [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5923), which addressed the design of the `agent.generate` API. The discussion clarified that a generic `generate()` function was too broad. A consensus formed around creating more specific functions, such as `generateText` and `generateImage`, to handle distinct modalities. This culminated in a concrete proposal for a `generateText(input: string, options?: GenerateTextOptions)` function signature, which is now ready for implementation.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active discussion on API design. The conversation in issue [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5923) between contributors @tylermcwilliams and @0xbbjoker exemplifies the project's collaborative spirit. The exchange successfully moved from a high-level question to a specific, actionable API proposal, with @tylermcwilliams offering to drive the implementation forward.
