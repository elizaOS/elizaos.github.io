# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter Monthly Report (January 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
In January 2026, development for the OpenRouter plugin focused on enhancing integration metadata and improving ecosystem attribution. The primary theme of the month was increasing the visibility and tracking of ElizaOS agents within the OpenRouter platform. By introducing support for specific identification headers, the project is moving toward better transparency and professional-grade integration with its primary LLM routing provider.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### Attribution & Metadata Enhancements
The core technical focus this month was on refining how the plugin identifies itself to the OpenRouter API. This ensures that agents built on the ElizaOS framework are correctly attributed and recognized within the broader AI ecosystem.

*   **Header Support for Attribution:** A significant feature was initiated to add support for `X-Title` and `HTTP-Referer` headers. This development allows developers to pass custom application titles and referral URLs, which OpenRouter uses to track usage and display rankings. This is a key step for modularity, as it allows individual agents to maintain their own identity while using the shared plugin ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### New & Active Issues
*   **Integration Tracking:** The most prominent active work revolves around the implementation of attribution headers ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23)). This remains the primary focus for ensuring the plugin meets the latest standards for OpenRouter's ranking and discovery features. There are currently no reported blockers or critical bugs identified in the provided data for this period.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Activity this month was characterized by targeted feature requests aimed at improving the professional integration of ElizaOS with OpenRouter. The opening of PR [#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23) indicates an active effort to align the plugin with OpenRouter’s best practices for developers. The focus remains on technical refinement and ensuring that the modular AI architecture can be properly represented in external dashboards and analytics tools.
