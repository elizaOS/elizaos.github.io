# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter Monthly Report (February 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
In February 2026, development for the OpenRouter plugin focused on improving the integration's visibility and metadata accuracy within the OpenRouter ecosystem. The primary achievement was the implementation of enhanced attribution headers, ensuring that ElizaOS agents are correctly identified and ranked. This work strengthens the project's professional footprint and aligns with our core philosophy of building transparent, modular AI architectures.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### Enhanced OpenRouter Attribution
The core technical focus this month was on refining how the plugin communicates with the OpenRouter API to ensure proper application identification.
*   **Metadata and Ranking Support:** Developers implemented support for `X-Title` and `HTTP-Referer` headers. This allows the application's display name and primary identifier to be correctly reflected in OpenRouter's rankings and analytics.
*   **Configuration Updates:** New environment variables, `OPENROUTER_APP_TITLE` and `OPENROUTER_SITE_URL`, were introduced to provide developers with granular control over their agent's identity.
*   **Documentation:** The README was updated to reflect these changes, ensuring users can easily configure their attribution settings.
*   **Impactful PR:** [#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23)

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The project maintained a stable state throughout February. 
*   **Closed Issues:** No specific issues were closed during this period, as the primary work was driven through direct pull request contributions.
*   **New & Active Issues:** There were no new issues reported or active discussions with high engagement (3+ comments) during this timeframe, suggesting a period of focused, incremental improvement rather than bug-driven development.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was characterized by targeted improvements to the plugin's integration standards. The successful merge of the attribution enhancements indicates a commitment to maintaining high-quality standards for how ElizaOS agents interact with external model providers. The project remains in a stable maintenance and enhancement phase, with clear documentation updates accompanying technical changes to support the contributor and user community.
