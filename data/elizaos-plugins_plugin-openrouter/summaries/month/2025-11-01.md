# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
November's development was focused on a significant functional expansion for the OpenRouter plugin. The primary achievement was the integration of support for text embedding models, a crucial step in enhancing the plugin's versatility. This update broadens the range of AI tasks the plugin can handle, directly supporting the ElizaOS mission of creating adaptable and modular AI systems. While development was concentrated, this new capability lays the groundwork for more sophisticated agent behaviors that rely on semantic understanding and vector-based operations.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month centered on adding a new model type to the plugin's capabilities.

-   **Text Embedding Model Integration**
    A new feature was introduced to support `TEXT_EMBEDDING` models. This enhancement enables the plugin to leverage embedding models available through OpenRouter for tasks like semantic search and text similarity. The implementation in PR [#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/17) involved creating a dedicated handler for text embedding, registering the new model type within the plugin's definitions, and updating configuration utilities to recognize `OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_` settings.
