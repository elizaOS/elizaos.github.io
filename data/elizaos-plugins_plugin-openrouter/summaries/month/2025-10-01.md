# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter Monthly Report (October 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
October was a month of targeted improvements and collaborative problem-solving. Development focused on enhancing core functionality with an important bug fix for AI SDK v5 integration, ensuring more reliable tool execution. We also invested in long-term project health by introducing automated dependency management with Renovate. A significant portion of the month's activity centered on a community-driven investigation into a critical dependency issue, which successfully identified a root cause in a specific version of `@elizaos/core`, showcasing the strength of our collaborative troubleshooting process.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month focused on bug fixes and improving the development infrastructure.

- **AI SDK v5 Integration and Tooling Fix**
  A critical bug was addressed by updating the tool execution logic to be compatible with AI SDK v5. This fix involved parsing tool results directly from step content and utilizing `stepCountIs` for proper stopping conditions. As part of this effort, core and TypeScript dependencies were also updated ([#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/15)).

- **Infrastructure Automation**
  To streamline maintenance and keep dependencies current, a Renovate configuration was added to the repository. This will help automate the process of updating packages, reducing manual effort and improving security ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/16)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month was dominated by the investigation of a single, high-impact bug.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in October.

- **New & Active Issues:** The primary focus was on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6031), concerning module import errors when using Eliza CLI version 1.6.1. The discussion revealed that the issue was specific to this version, with both older and newer versions of `@elizaos/core` functioning correctly. Community members provided detailed diagnostics, including `tsc --noEmit` output, which pointed toward malformed type definition files in the `@elizaos/core` package. An AI agent's analysis corroborated this, concluding that v1.6.1 was likely published with missing declaration files and recommended upgrading to a newer version.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was highly visible this month, particularly in the diagnosis of issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6031). Contributors `matteo-brandolino` and `0xbbjoker` worked together to provide detailed error reports and run diagnostic commands, which were crucial in pinpointing the problem. In a notable example of leveraging AI, an agent named `claude` was tasked with analyzing the issue, providing a comprehensive root cause analysis that guided the resolution path. This collaborative spirit between community members and the use of AI tools exemplifies the project's core philosophies.
