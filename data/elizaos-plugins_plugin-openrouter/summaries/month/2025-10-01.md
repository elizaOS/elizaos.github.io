# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development focused on enhancing the plugin's stability and maintainability. A significant update involved integrating with AI SDK v5, which resolved a critical bug and improved how tool results are handled. Concurrently, we bolstered our project infrastructure by introducing Renovate to automate dependency management. A key challenge this month has been the investigation of an import error linked to a specific version of the `@Elizaos/core` package, highlighting ongoing efforts to ensure seamless compatibility within the broader ElizaOS ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on core dependency upgrades and improving our development infrastructure.

-   **AI SDK v5 Integration and Tooling Fix**
    A crucial bug fix was merged to align the plugin with AI SDK v5. This update changes how tool execution is handled by parsing tool results directly from step content and utilizing `stepCountIs` for stopping conditions. This effort, completed in PR [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/15), also included necessary bumps to the core and TypeScript package versions.

-   **Infrastructure Automation**
    To improve long-term project health and reduce manual maintenance, Renovate configuration was added via PR [#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/16). This will automate the process of keeping project dependencies up-to-date.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed during this period, but a significant active issue drew attention.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    No issues were closed in October.

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    No new issues were opened. However, significant discussion continued on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6031), which concerns import errors for `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` when using Eliza CLI version 1.61. The investigation now points to a potential packaging issue with type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package itself. The problem appears specific to version 1.6.1, as downgrading or upgrading the core package reportedly resolves the errors.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was most visible in the diagnostic efforts around issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6031). Contributors like `matteo-brandolino` and `0xbbjoker` worked together to troubleshoot the import error, demonstrating effective cross-team problem-solving as the issue appears to stem from a core dependency rather than the plugin itself.
