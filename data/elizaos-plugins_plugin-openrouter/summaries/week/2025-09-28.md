## 🛠️ Key Developments
### AI SDK v5 Integration and Tooling Improvements
A key bug fix was implemented to align tool execution with the latest AI SDK v5 standards. This update changes the mechanism for handling tool outputs, now parsing results directly from step content. The integration also introduces the use of `stepCountIs` for more precise control over stopping conditions. This foundational work, completed in PR [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/15), also involved updating Core and TypeScript versions.
