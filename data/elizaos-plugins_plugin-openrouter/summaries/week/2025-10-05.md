# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were centered on infrastructure enhancement and critical issue diagnosis. A significant step was taken to automate dependency management by introducing a Renovate configuration. The majority of the week's activity, however, was dedicated to a collaborative investigation into a module import error. This effort successfully identified the root cause as a build pipeline issue in a specific version of the `@elizaos/core` package, providing a clear path forward for affected users and demonstrating strong community-driven troubleshooting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The sole technical development this week focused on improving project maintenance and stability.

- **Infrastructure Automation:** To streamline dependency management and keep the project up-to-date, a pull request ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/16)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration. This will help automate the process of updating dependencies, reducing manual maintenance overhead.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened and no issues were closed this week. The focus remained on a single, significant active issue.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - The primary focus was on **Issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6031): Module Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61**. Throughout the week, contributors investigated why imports were failing in `index.ts`. The discussion, involving diagnostic commands like `tsc --noEmit`, revealed numerous `TS2305` errors. The investigation concluded that the problem is not within the plugin but stems from malformed or missing TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, likely due to a faulty build/publish process for that specific version. The recommended workaround for users is to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later, and a suggestion was made for the core ElizaOS team to consider deprecating the problematic v1.6.1.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted effective collaboration in diagnosing a complex, cross-repository issue. The discussion on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6031) saw active participation from community members like `@matteo-brandolino`, `@0xbbjoker`, and `@wtfsayo`. Their combined efforts in providing diagnostic outputs, confirming behavior across different environments, and analyzing the evidence were crucial in pinpointing the root cause within the core framework rather than the plugin itself. This collaborative problem-solving is a strong indicator of a healthy and engaged contributor community.
