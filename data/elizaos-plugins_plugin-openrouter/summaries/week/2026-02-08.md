# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter Weekly Report (Feb 8 - 14, 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week focused on improving the integration footprint of the OpenRouter plugin within the broader AI ecosystem. The primary achievement was the implementation of enhanced attribution headers, ensuring that ElizaOS agents are correctly identified and ranked on the OpenRouter platform. This update strengthens the project's visibility and provides maintainers with better telemetry regarding the framework's usage across different deployments.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### Platform Attribution & Metadata
The core technical focus this week was refining how the plugin identifies itself to the OpenRouter API. By implementing support for specific metadata headers, the plugin now ensures that individual agent deployments can be properly recognized in rankings and usage statistics.

*   **Enhanced OpenRouter Attribution:** Support was added for `X-Title` and `HTTP-Referer` headers. This allows developers to define a custom display name and a primary identifier for their applications.
*   **Configuration Updates:** Two new environment variables, `OPENROUTER_APP_TITLE` and `OPENROUTER_SITE_URL`, were introduced to manage these identifiers. The project documentation was updated to reflect these changes, ensuring a smooth transition for users. ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23))

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

*   **Closed Issues:** No specific issues were closed during this period; however, the implementation of PR [#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23) addressed the functional requirement for better platform attribution.
*   **New & Active Issues:** There were no new issues reported or active discussions with high engagement (3+ comments) during this timeframe, suggesting a stable period for the plugin's current feature set.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was streamlined and focused on the integration of attribution features. The successful merge of the attribution enhancements indicates a commitment to maintaining high standards for how ElizaOS interacts with upstream providers. While the volume of public discussion was low, the technical output directly supports the project's goal of building a professional, modular AI agent framework that is well-represented in the wider AI ecosystem.
