# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development activity centered on a significant functional expansion for the OpenRouter plugin. The primary achievement was the integration of support for text embedding models. This enhancement broadens the plugin's capabilities beyond text generation, aligning with the ElizaOS goal of creating adaptable and modular AI systems. The work involved adding new handlers and updating configuration utilities to accommodate this new model type.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The focus this week was on introducing a new feature to the plugin.

- **Text Embedding Model Integration**
  A major feature was merged to enable the use of `TEXT_EMBEDDING` models through the OpenRouter plugin. This work, completed in PR [#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/17), involved creating a dedicated handler for text embedding requests, updating the plugin's core model definitions, and modifying configuration utilities to recognize new `OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_` environment settings. This lays the groundwork for agents to perform tasks requiring semantic understanding and vector-based operations.
