## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced OpenRouter Attribution
Support for `X-Title` and `HTTP-Referer` headers has been added to improve OpenRouter attribution. This allows the application's display name and primary identifier to be correctly reflected in rankings. The `OPENROUTER_APP_TITLE` and `OPENROUTER_SITE_URL` environment variables are now used for this purpose, with updated documentation in the README.
