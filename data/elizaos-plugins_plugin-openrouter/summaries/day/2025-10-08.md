### Investigation into `@elizaos/core` Import Errors [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6031)
Discussion continued regarding the "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61" issue. User matteo-brandolino confirmed the problem persists on their Arch Linux setup with Node v24.9.0 and Bun v1.2.22, providing detailed `tsc --noEmit` output showing numerous `TS2305` errors. The user also noted that the issue appears specific to `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, with both older (1.5.15) and newer versions working correctly. An AI agent, claude, was tasked with diagnosing the issue and provided a comprehensive root cause analysis, concluding that version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core` was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. The agent recommended users upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later and suggested the ElizaOS team consider deprecating v1.6.1 and adding publish-time validation.
