### Investigation into `@elizaos/core` Import Errors [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6031)
The primary focus of today's activity was the continued investigation into import errors when using `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1 with Eliza CLI. The latest comments indicate:
- **User Environment Details:** @matteo-brandolino confirmed using Arch Linux, providing further context to their environment.
- **Clarification on OS:** @wtfsayo inquired about the operating system, to which @matteo-brandolino responded with "arch linux sorry". This suggests an attempt to narrow down environment-specific factors, although the previous analysis by Claude indicated the issue is version-specific and environment-independent.
