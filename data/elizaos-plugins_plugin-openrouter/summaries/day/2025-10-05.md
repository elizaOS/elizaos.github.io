### Module Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6031))
Discussion continued on the issue where imports are not found in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61. @matteo-brandolino suggested that the problem might stem from type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing source files not included in the published package. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the issue. @0xbbjoker requested running `bun x tsc --noEmit` to further diagnose, suspecting an IDE TSC compiler issue. @matteo-brandolino provided the output of this command, showing numerous `TS2305` errors related to missing exported members from `@elizaos/core` in various files, reinforcing the initial assessment of type definition problems.
