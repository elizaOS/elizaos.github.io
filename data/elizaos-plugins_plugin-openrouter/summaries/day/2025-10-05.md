### Import Errors in `index.ts` with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6031))
Discussion continued regarding import errors in `index.ts` when creating new projects with Eliza CLI 1.61. The latest comment from matteo-brandolino suggests the issue might stem from type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically `dist/index.d.ts` and `dist/types/index.d.ts`, referencing source files not present in the published package. Downgrading to version 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 reportedly resolves the problem. Previously, 0xbbjoker confirmed it worked on their setup and provided troubleshooting steps.
