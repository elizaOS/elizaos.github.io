# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (January 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
In January 2026, the ElizaOS plugin registry continued its steady expansion as a modular hub for AI agent capabilities. The month's activity focused on the integration of new community-driven plugins, reinforcing the project's core philosophy of composability and open collaboration. Key additions included specialized routing and general-purpose integrations, signaling a growing ecosystem of tools available for developers building on the ElizaOS framework.

## 🛠️️ Key Developments

### Ecosystem Expansion & Plugin Integration
The primary technical activity this month centered on broadening the registry's offerings through new external contributions. These additions enhance the versatility of the framework by providing developers with more "off-the-shelf" modules.

*   **Specialized Routing:** The introduction of the `@zane-archer/plugin-aimo-router` ([#247](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/247)) suggests a move toward more sophisticated logic handling within the agent architecture, allowing for better task delegation or message routing.
*   **General Integrations:** The registry also saw the addition of the `@kamiyo/eliza` plugin ([#246](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/246)), further diversifying the suite of available tools for agent customization.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Based on the provided data for this period, the focus remained on the intake of new features via pull requests. There were no reported bug fixes or new issues opened during this specific timeframe, indicating a stable environment for the current registry infrastructure as it scales to accommodate new entries.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The activity in January highlights the decentralized nature of the ElizaOS project. The contributions came from independent developers (Kamiyo and Zane Archer), demonstrating that the registry is successfully serving as a collaborative touchpoint for the community. The seamless opening of pull requests for new plugins reflects a low-friction contribution process, encouraging external developers to share their modules and contribute to the collective intelligence of the ecosystem.
