# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (October 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
October was a month of significant expansion for the ElizaOS plugin ecosystem, reinforcing the project's commitment to modularity and Web3 integration. Development focused on growing the registry with new plugins for core relay services, Web3 data via Moralis, and self-sovereign identity through the Nuggets platform. However, this growth was paired with critical community feedback highlighting challenges in the developer experience. A significant new CLI bug and a detailed report of user frustration with documentation underscored the need to improve usability and onboarding for contributors and users.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The primary focus this month was the expansion of the plugin registry, adding new capabilities across core infrastructure, Web3, and identity.

### New Plugin Integrations
- **Core Services:** The `@elizaos/plugin-relay` was added to the registry, enhancing the core capabilities of the ElizaOS ecosystem ([#234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/234)).
- **Web3 & Identity:** The registry continued its growth in decentralized technologies with two key additions. A pull request was opened to add the `@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2` for Moralis v2 integration ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)). Additionally, a new "nuggets" plugin was merged, enabling self-sovereign identity and data verification with the Nuggets platform ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/236)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
While development progressed on new features, critical issues related to usability and stability emerged.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed during this period.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **CLI Installation Bug ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6088)):** A critical issue was reported where the ElizaOS CLI fails with a "Cannot find module" error after a standard installation from npm. The problem appears to be a bundling issue in the published package, as building from source works correctly. This presents a significant barrier for new users trying to get started with the framework.
    - **Developer Experience Feedback ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6070)):** Discussion continued on a previously closed issue regarding plugin documentation and scaffolding. A user shared detailed feedback about significant frustration with the framework's usability, citing a week of effort before abandoning it for another solution. This conversation has become a crucial channel for understanding and addressing major pain points in the developer onboarding process.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community interaction this month was highlighted by the important, albeit critical, feedback loop on issue [#6070](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6070). Maintainer `yungalgo` engaged directly with user `ryanmstokes`, who expressed frustration with the project's documentation and overall usability. This dialogue, while surfacing difficult feedback, demonstrates a commitment to listening to the community and gathering the specific details needed to improve the developer experience. The user's willingness to provide a detailed follow-up is a valuable contribution to the project's future direction.
