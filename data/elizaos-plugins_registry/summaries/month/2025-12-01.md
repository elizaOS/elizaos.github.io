# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December was a month of strategic expansion for the plugin registry, reinforcing ElizaOS's commitment to both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems. Development focused exclusively on integrating new capabilities, with three significant plugins added to enhance agent functionality. These additions broaden the framework's reach into DeFi, decentralized social media, and communication. A notable theme was the move towards greater autonomy, exemplified by the addition of a self-hosted Farcaster plugin that reduces reliance on external APIs.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
All development work this month centered on expanding the plugin ecosystem with new integrations.

*   **New Plugin Integrations:** The registry was enhanced with three new plugins, expanding the capabilities available to ElizaOS agents.
    *   A Moralis DeFi plugin (`@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2`) was added to provide agents with Moralis v2 functionalities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).
    *   An OpenChat integration (`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) was integrated, enabling agents to use OpenChat for communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).
    *   A self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) was introduced, allowing agents to connect to a local Snapchain/Hubble hub. This important addition removes dependencies on third-party APIs like Neynar and ensures data freshness ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).
