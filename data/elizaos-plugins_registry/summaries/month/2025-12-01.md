# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December's development focused on expanding the ElizaOS ecosystem through the integration of new plugins. The registry grew with three significant additions that enhance agent capabilities in both Web2 and Web3 domains. Key integrations include a Moralis DeFi plugin for decentralized finance tasks and an OpenChat plugin for communication. Notably, the addition of a self-hosted Farcaster plugin marks a step towards greater decentralization and autonomy by reducing reliance on external APIs, directly aligning with the project's core philosophy.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
All development this month centered on expanding the plugin registry with new community-contributed integrations.

*   **Web3 & DeFi Capabilities:**
    *   The `@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2` was added to the registry, equipping ElizaOS agents with Moralis DeFi functionalities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).
*   **Web2 & Communication:**
    *   The `@tonyflam/plugin-openchat` was registered, enabling agents to integrate with the OpenChat platform ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).
*   **Decentralized Social & Self-Hosting:**
    *   A self-hosted Farcaster plugin, `plugin-farcaster-local-hub`, was integrated ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)). This plugin allows agents to use Farcaster via a local Snapchain/Hubble hub, removing dependencies on third-party services like Neynar and ensuring data freshness from the Hub API.
