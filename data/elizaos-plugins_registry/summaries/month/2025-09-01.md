# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
September was a month of significant growth and foundational planning for the ElizaOS plugin ecosystem. Development was characterized by a major expansion of the plugin registry, with proposals for over a dozen new plugins. A critical bug fix was implemented to ensure correct plugin compatibility, strengthening the registry's reliability. Concurrently, a major architectural discussion began around a comprehensive refactoring of the Eliza CLI, aiming to simplify its structure and delegate more logic to individual projects, setting the stage for future scalability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on improving the core registry's stability and dramatically expanding its offerings.

- **Registry Compatibility Fix:** A crucial bug in plugin compatibility detection was resolved. The fix involved switching from point satisfaction to semantic version range intersection for v0 and v1 bands, ensuring the registry correctly classifies plugin versions and prevents misclassifications ([#214](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/214)).

- **Plugin Ecosystem Expansion:** A significant effort was made to broaden the tools available to ElizaOS agents, with numerous pull requests opened to add new plugins to the registry. These proposed additions include:
    - `@testorg-eliza/plugin-sourcegraph` ([#215](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/215), [#216](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/216))
    - `@standujar/plugin-composio` ([#217](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/217))
    - `plugin-delta` ([#218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/218))
    - A batch of ten "jello" and "gorpy" themed plugins ([#219](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/219)-[#228](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/228))
    - `@yungalgo/plugin-karma` ([#229](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/229))

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue tracking this month was dominated by a major architectural discussion and active community-led troubleshooting.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - A "path not found" error occurring during project creation was resolved. The reporter confirmed that a fresh installation with the latest CLI version fixed the problem, closing the issue ([#5856](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5856)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Eliza CLI Refactoring Initiative ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5860)):** A significant new issue was opened to plan a major refactor of the Eliza CLI. The core proposal is to simplify the CLI by delegating more runtime logic and composition to project directories. The discussion outlined a new architecture with clear responsibilities for the server package, CLI, and starter projects, sparking valuable community feedback on the proposed direction.
    - **Plugin Publishing Process Clarification ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5813)):** An active discussion helped a user who was unable to see their published plugin in the registry. The community clarified that using the `--npm` flag bypasses the registry PR creation process and provided guidance on the correct procedure, highlighting an area for potential documentation or UX improvement.
    - **Image Generation in Discord ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5809)):** Troubleshooting continued for an issue where image generation fails in Discord but works in the web UI. A potential fix was identified in a pull request in the main `elizaOS/eliza` repository.
    - **API Rate Limiting ([#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/40)):** A contributor reported the implementation of a rate limiter to prevent exceeding API usage limits, addressing a concern about high consumption at startup.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was strong this month, with core contributors and the wider community engaging in deep technical discussions and mutual support.

- The discussion around the **CLI refactor ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5860))** was a prime example of healthy collaboration, with `standujar` leading the proposal and users like `wtfsayo` and `odilitime` providing constructive feedback and cautionary notes.
- Community support was evident in issue triage, particularly in **[#5813](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5813)**, where contributors `yungalgo` and `1BDO` actively guided a user through the plugin publishing process.
- The high volume of pull requests for new plugins from various contributors indicates a vibrant and growing developer community actively building on the ElizaOS framework.
