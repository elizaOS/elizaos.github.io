# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of steady growth for the ElizaOS plugin ecosystem, with several new integrations added to the registry. This expansion, however, was paralleled by significant community-driven troubleshooting efforts on critical plugin issues. The stability of the Twitter plugin emerged as a major concern, with multiple issues related to client initialization and API rate limits pointing towards the potential necessity of paid API tiers. Concurrently, discussions around cross-platform loading failures and core callback interference highlighted ongoing challenges in ensuring plugin reliability and compatibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary focus of completed work this month was the expansion of the plugin registry, enhancing the integration capabilities of the ElizaOS framework.

*   **Plugin Registry Expansion:** The registry was updated with several new plugins to broaden the ecosystem. This included the addition of `plugin-mattermost` ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)), `plugin-bonsai` ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191)), and a batch of plugins from the "BD list" ([#189](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/189)). A request to add `@manuelbarbas/plugin-fair` was also opened ([#190](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/190)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were formally closed in July, but active discussions centered on diagnosing and resolving several key problems.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Twitter Plugin Instability:** The `plugin-twitter` was the subject of multiple high-priority discussions. Users reported client creation failures ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/36), [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31)) and persistent "Too Many Requests" errors due to API rate limits, even with updated versions ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38)). The conversation suggests that the free Twitter API tier may no longer be sufficient, potentially making autonomous Twitter agents unfeasible without a paid subscription.
    *   **Local AI Plugin Loading Failures:** A critical issue ([#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5499)) with `plugin-local-ai` failing to load was found to affect both Windows and Mac systems. While a fix was reportedly available in a new release (`v1.2.1`), the discussion highlighted ongoing cross-platform compatibility challenges.
    *   **Custom Plugin Callback Interference:** A complex issue ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947)) was discussed where a core provider's state was interfering with a custom plugin's action callback. A potential fix was proposed, with follow-up discussions underway to confirm the resolution.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was strong this month, primarily focused on collaborative troubleshooting of active issues. The various Twitter plugin problems ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/36), [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38)) saw numerous users (`yasir23`, `joaoCarvalho1000`, `RolandOne`, `Ovodo`) confirming the bugs and sharing their findings. Similarly, the `plugin-local-ai` loading issue ([#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5499)) brought together several contributors (`scottrepreneur`, `david-dina`, `ChristopherTrimboli`) to diagnose the cross-platform problem. This activity demonstrates a healthy, active user base dedicated to identifying and resolving issues within the ecosystem.
