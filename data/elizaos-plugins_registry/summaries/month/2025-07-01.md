# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of steady growth for the ElizaOS plugin ecosystem, with a focus on expanding the registry's offerings. Several new plugins were successfully integrated, including `plugin-mattermost`, `plugin-bonsai`, and others from the BD list. While the registry grew, significant community effort was directed towards troubleshooting persistent issues in key plugins, particularly `plugin-twitter` and `plugin-local-ai`. These discussions highlighted challenges related to platform compatibility, API limitations, and versioning, underscoring the ongoing need for robust maintenance and clear user guidance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development this month centered exclusively on expanding the plugin registry, enhancing the integration capabilities of the ElizaOS framework.

-   **Plugin Registry Expansion:** The registry was broadened with the addition of several new plugins. The `plugin-mattermost` was added to expand client integrations ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)), and `plugin-bonsai` was published to the index ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191)). A significant update also incorporated a batch of new plugins from the BD list ([#189](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/189)). A request to add `@manuelbarbas/plugin-fair` was also opened ([#190](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/190)), signaling continued community contributions.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were formally closed this month, but there was significant activity and discussion around several critical open issues, with a strong focus on plugin stability and compatibility.

-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in this period.

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Twitter Plugin Challenges:** The `plugin-twitter` was the subject of multiple active discussions. Users reported widespread "Failed to create Twitter Client" errors in issues [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31) and [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/36), even after updating to suggested versions. Another key issue ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38)) involved "Failed to fetch Home timeline" errors, which were linked to the limitations of the free Twitter API tier, with maintainers clarifying that a paid plan is required for the plugin to function correctly.
    *   **Local AI Plugin Loading Failures:** Issue [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5499) saw continued reports of `plugin-local-ai` failing to load, with users confirming the problem on both Windows and Mac. The community suggested using hosted models as a workaround, while a maintainer advised that upgrading to `v1.2.1` of the plugin should resolve the issue.
    *   **Custom Plugin Callback Interference:** Discussion continued in [#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947) regarding a custom plugin's action being overridden by a provider. A potential fix was proposed, and follow-up discussion centered on verifying the fix and checking for conflicting actions in `plugin-bootstrap`.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was high this month, primarily centered within the issue tracker. Users like `yasir23`, `joaoCarvalho1000`, `ksaitor`, and `web-mickey` were active in reporting bugs and confirming they were experiencing similar problems, providing valuable data for triage. Maintainer `ChristopherTrimboli` was notably active in responding to user reports, offering clarifications on API requirements for the Twitter plugin and providing versioning advice for the Local AI plugin. The submission of a new plugin by `manuelbarbas` also demonstrates ongoing external contributions to the ecosystem's growth.
