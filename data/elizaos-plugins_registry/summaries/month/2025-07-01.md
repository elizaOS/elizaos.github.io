# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of steady growth for the ElizaOS plugin ecosystem, with a focus on expanding the registry's breadth. Several new plugins were successfully integrated, including `plugin-mattermost`, `plugin-bonsai`, and a collection from the BD list, broadening the platform's capabilities. This progress was balanced by significant community engagement in troubleshooting persistent issues within existing plugins. The stability of the Twitter plugin and cross-platform compatibility for `plugin-local-ai` emerged as key areas of concern, with active discussions highlighting potential blockers for users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Development work this month centered exclusively on expanding the number of available plugins in the registry.

-   **Plugin Registry Expansion:** The registry grew with the addition of several new integrations. The `plugin-mattermost` was added to enhance client options ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)), followed by the publication of `plugin-bonsai` ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191)). A significant update also incorporated a batch of new plugins from the BD list ([#189](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/189)). Additionally, a pull request was opened to add `@manuelbarbas/plugin-fair` ([#190](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/190)), signaling further growth.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed in July, but community discussion was highly active around several critical problems, indicating a focus on debugging and user support.

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Twitter Plugin Instability:** A major theme this month was the ongoing difficulty with the Twitter plugin. Users reported multiple, related failures, including errors during client initialization ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/36)) and persistent "Failed to fetch Home timeline" errors due to API rate limits, even with updated plugin versions ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38)). Discussions suggest these problems may be linked to Twitter's API subscription tiers, posing a significant challenge for users on the free tier.
    -   **Plugin Loading and Compatibility:** Cross-platform loading issues for `plugin-local-ai` were a key topic, with users on both Windows and Mac reporting failures ([#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5499)). A maintainer suggested that version `v1.2.1` of the plugin contains a fix. Another discussion centered on a custom plugin's callback being incorrectly overridden by a core provider, with a potential fix and further investigation underway ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community collaboration was a standout feature of the month, primarily focused on issue triage and collective troubleshooting. The issue threads for the Twitter and `plugin-local-ai` plugins saw a high degree of engagement, with multiple users (`yasir23`, `joaoCarvalho1000`, `ksaitor`, `web-mickey`) confirming bugs and sharing their experiences. This collaborative debugging provides valuable, real-world feedback. Contributor `ChristopherTrimboli` was particularly active, offering guidance across several issues, clarifying versioning fixes, and explaining the nuances of Twitter API tiers. This dynamic highlights a healthy, engaged community working together to improve plugin stability.
