# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July's focus was on expanding the ElizaOS plugin ecosystem while simultaneously addressing critical stability issues in existing integrations. The registry grew with the addition of several new plugins, including those for Mattermost, Bonsai, and others from the BD list, broadening the platform's capabilities. However, a significant portion of community effort was dedicated to troubleshooting persistent problems, most notably with the Twitter plugin's API rate limits and client creation failures, as well as loading issues with the local AI plugin. This highlights a dual focus on both growth and maintenance to ensure a robust and reliable platform.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development effort this month focused on expanding the range of available integrations for ElizaOS. Several new plugins were successfully added to the registry, enhancing the platform's capabilities.

- **Plugin Registry Expansion:**
  - Key additions include `plugin-mattermost` ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)), `plugin-bonsai` ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191)), and a batch of plugins from the BD list ([#189](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/189)).
  - A pull request to add `@manuelbarbas/plugin-fair` ([#190](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/190)) was also opened, signaling continued growth.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed in July, indicating that focus was on discussion and troubleshooting rather than final resolutions. The community was highly engaged in diagnosing several complex, active issues.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Ongoing Challenges with the Twitter Plugin:** Multiple issues highlighted instability with the Twitter integration. Discussions on [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31) and [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/36) centered on a "Failed to create Twitter Client" error, with multiple users confirming the problem persists even after updates. Issue [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38) focused on "Too Many Requests" errors when fetching the timeline, with discussion clarifying that the free Twitter API tier is likely the cause, while the paid "Basic" tier appears to work.
  - **Cross-Platform Loading Failures for `plugin-local-ai`:** Issue [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5499) revealed that the plugin was failing to load not only on Windows but also on Mac. Maintainers advised that upgrading to `v1.2.1` of the plugin should resolve the problem.
  - **Plugin Callback Interference:** In issue [#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947), a user reported that a custom plugin's action callback was being incorrectly overridden. A potential fix was proposed, and discussion is ongoing to confirm if the solution is effective.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community collaboration was a major theme in July, primarily centered around troubleshooting in the issues section. Multiple users, including `yasir23`, `joaoCarvalho1000`, `ksaitor`, and `web-mickey`, actively participated by confirming bugs, providing context, and sharing their experiences on issues related to the Twitter and Local AI plugins ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/36), [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38), [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5499)).
