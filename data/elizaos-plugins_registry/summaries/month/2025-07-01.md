# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of significant growth for the ElizaOS plugin ecosystem, with a focus on expanding the registry's offerings. Several new plugins were added, increasing the range of available integrations for agents. Concurrently, the community was highly engaged in diagnosing and troubleshooting persistent issues, particularly around third-party service integrations like the Twitter plugin and platform-specific compatibility for the Local AI plugin. This collaborative effort underscores the project's commitment to both expanding capabilities and ensuring existing plugins are robust and reliable for users.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development effort this month centered on expanding the plugin registry to include new community and first-party contributions.

*   **Registry Expansion:** The registry was updated with several new plugins, enhancing the modular capabilities of the ElizaOS framework.
    *   The `plugin-mattermost` was officially added, providing a new client integration ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)).
    *   A batch of new plugins from the "BD list" was integrated to keep the registry comprehensive ([#189](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/189)).
    *   The `plugin-bonsai` was published and added to the index ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191)).
    *   A pull request was opened to add `@manuelbarbas/plugin-fair` to the registry ([#190](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/190)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were formally closed this month, but there was significant activity and discussion around several key problems, highlighting ongoing challenges and areas for future work.

*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in the provided reporting period.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Twitter Plugin Instability:** A major focus of community discussion revolved around multiple issues with the Twitter plugin. Users reported client creation failures ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/36)) and "Too Many Requests" errors related to API rate limits, even with search disabled ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38)). Discussions clarified that the free Twitter API tier is likely insufficient, but users on newer plugin versions (1.2.16) still reported problems, suggesting these issues remain a significant blocker for building reliable Twitter agents.
    *   **Local AI Plugin Loading Failures:** A critical compatibility issue ([#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5499)) affecting `plugin-local-ai` on both Windows and Mac was discussed. Community collaboration pointed to a fix available in version `v1.2.1` of the plugin.
    *   **Custom Plugin Callback Interference:** An ongoing discussion in [#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947) addressed a bug where a custom plugin's action was being overridden by a core provider. A potential fix was proposed to better isolate state composition, and maintainers followed up to confirm if the issue persists.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was a standout feature of this month's activity, particularly within the issue tracker.

*   There was a high degree of collaborative troubleshooting on display. In issues related to the Twitter and Local AI plugins, multiple users (`yasir23`, `joaoCarvalho1000`, `ksaitor`, `web-mickey`) actively confirmed they were experiencing the same problems, providing valuable validation for maintainers.
*   Contributors like `ChristopherTrimboli` and `tcm390` were actively involved in these discussions, providing support, suggesting workarounds (such as upgrading to specific versions or clarifying API tier requirements), and guiding users toward solutions. This direct engagement between maintainers and users is crucial for diagnosing complex integration and compatibility issues.
