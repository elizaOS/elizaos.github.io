# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of steady growth for the ElizaOS plugin ecosystem, with a focus on expanding the registry's offerings. Several new plugins were successfully integrated, including `plugin-mattermost`, `plugin-bonsai`, and others from the BD list, broadening the platform's capabilities. However, this expansion was paralleled by significant community-driven troubleshooting on critical issues within existing plugins. Persistent problems with the Twitter plugin, including client creation failures and API rate limits, along with loading issues for `plugin-local-ai`, highlighted ongoing challenges in maintaining robust third-party integrations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development effort this month centered on expanding the official plugin registry to provide users with a wider array of tools.

*   **New Plugin Integrations:** The registry was updated to include several new plugins, enhancing the integration options available to ElizaOS agents. Key additions include:
    *   `plugin-mattermost` ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188))
    *   `plugin-bonsai` ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191))
    *   A set of plugins from the BD list ([#189](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/189))

A pull request was also opened to add `@manuelbarbas/plugin-fair` ([#190](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/190)), signaling continued community contributions to the ecosystem.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed in July, but significant discussions took place around several active and potentially blocking issues.

*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved and closed this month.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Twitter Plugin Instability:** A cluster of related issues ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/36), [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38)) dominated discussions. Users reported persistent client creation failures and memory insertion errors, even with updated versions. The most critical problem appears to be severe API rate limiting ("Too Many Requests"), which renders timeline fetching unreliable. The conversation suggests that autonomous Twitter agents may be unfeasible without a paid Twitter API subscription, a significant hurdle for many users.
    *   **Cross-Platform Loading Failures:** `plugin-local-ai` was reported to fail during loading on both Windows and Mac systems ([#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5499)). While community members suggested workarounds like using hosted models, it was also noted that a fix may be available in `v1.2.1` of the plugin.
    *   **Custom Plugin Callback Interference:** An ongoing issue ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947)) involves a custom plugin's action callback being incorrectly overridden by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider. A potential fix was proposed, and discussion is ongoing to confirm its effectiveness.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was strong this month, primarily centered on collaborative troubleshooting within GitHub Issues. The threads for the Twitter plugin and `plugin-local-ai` saw active participation, with multiple users confirming bugs, sharing their environments, and proposing workarounds. This highlights a healthy, user-driven effort to identify and solve problems. The submission of a new community plugin ([#190](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/190)) further demonstrates active contribution to the growth of the ElizaOS ecosystem.
