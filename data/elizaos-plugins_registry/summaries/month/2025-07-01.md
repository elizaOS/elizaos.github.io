# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of steady growth for the plugin registry, balanced with intensive community-driven debugging of critical integration and compatibility issues. The registry was expanded with several new plugins, including `plugin-desearch`, `plugin-mattermost`, and `plugin-bonsai`. However, significant challenges persist, particularly with the Twitter plugin's stability following V2 migrations and cross-platform plugin loading failures on Windows. Community collaboration was a major theme, with contributors actively diagnosing bugs, proposing solutions, and discussing core improvements to documentation, deployment, and CLI consistency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary focus of completed work in July was the expansion of the plugin ecosystem. Several new plugins were successfully added to the registry, enhancing the capabilities available to ElizaOS agents.

*   **Plugin Registry Expansion:**
    *   `plugin-desearch` was added to enable integration with Desearch for enhanced search capabilities ([#187](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/187)).
    *   `plugin-mattermost` was integrated, making it available for use within the ecosystem ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)).
    *   `plugin-bonsai` was published to the registry ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191)).
    *   A batch of missing plugins from the BD list were also added to ensure completeness ([#189](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/189)).
    *   Proposals for new plugins like `@elizaos/plugin-datai` ([#185](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/185)) and `@manuelbarbas/plugin-fair` ([#190](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/190)) were also initiated.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
While no issues were formally closed in July, significant activity occurred around diagnosing and discussing existing problems. The community focused on identifying root causes for several high-impact bugs.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   No issues were closed during this period.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Twitter Plugin Instability:** A cluster of issues plagued the Twitter plugin. Users reported client initialization failures after migrating to V2 ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/36)), with the `v1.0.14` update reportedly introducing new memory-related errors. Additionally, discussions on "Too Many Requests" errors ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38)) clarified that a paid Twitter API subscription is now necessary to avoid rate limits, representing a significant hurdle for users.
    *   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Plugin loading failures on Windows were a recurring problem. Issues [#5407](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5407) (`plugin-openai`, `plugin-bootstrap`) and [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5499) (`plugin-local-ai`) saw active discussion, with community members confirming the bugs and working to reproduce them.
    *   **Core Usability and Framework Health:** Discussions continued on foundational improvements. These include standardizing CLI inputs ([#5295](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5295]), improving test consistency ([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5218)), overhauling documentation for non-technical users ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5234)), and exploring better agent deployment methods ([#5244](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5244)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was strong and essential for making progress on complex issues throughout July.

*   Several contributors, including @SYMBaiEX and @gcbsumid, collaborated on diagnosing the Windows plugin loading failure ([#5407](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5407)) by providing detailed reproduction steps and screenshots.
*   The discussion around streamlining agent deployment ([#5244](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5244)) saw @bealers offer their "elizify" project as a potential community solution, sparking suggestions for other platforms like Railway and Render.
*   Contributors like @Ifechukwudaniel showed initiative by requesting assignment to key usability issues related to documentation ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5234)) and CLI standardization ([#5295](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5295)).
*   The various Twitter plugin issues saw a high degree of participation, with multiple users confirming they experienced the same errors, which helped to establish the severity and scope of the problem.
