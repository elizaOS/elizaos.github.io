## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Plugin Visibility After Publishing:** Discussion continued on [#5813](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5813) regarding a plugin published on August 23rd that is not visible in the PR.
    - A new comment from 1BDO at 2025-09-03T19:12:55Z referenced PR [#218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/218).
    - yungalgo provided detailed troubleshooting steps at 2025-09-03T16:02:28Z, advising against using the `--npm` flag for registry and GitHub steps, and suggesting to remove the registry clone, re-run `elizaos publish` locally, and potentially alter the plugin name if NPM publishing conflicts arise.
    - 1BDO had previously provided detailed output of their `elizaos publish --npm` command at 2025-09-03T15:05:39Z, showing successful NPM publishing but noting that "NPM publishing currently does not update the registry."

- **Documentation for Rate Limiting:** Discussion on [#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/40) regarding clarifying documentation about basic tier requirements to avoid rate limiting errors.
    - ChuXo commented at 2025-09-03T11:56:21Z that a rate limiter has been implemented to only request posts if the monthly read limit is not reached.
