## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Plugin Visibility and Publishing Process Clarification
Discussions continued on [#5813](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5813), where a user reported their `plugin-delta-0.1.0` was successfully published to npm but not visible in the registry's pull requests. The user provided detailed logs of their `elizaos publish --npm` command, showing successful npm publication but also a message indicating "NPM publishing currently does not update the registry."

`yungalgo` provided extensive troubleshooting, explaining that the `--npm` flag bypasses registry and GitHub steps, focusing solely on npm publication. They advised the user to:
- Remove the registry clone from their organization.
- Run `elizaos publish` locally without the `--npm` flag.
- Consider altering the plugin's name if npm throws an error due to an existing package.
- Emphasized that the `elizaos publish` command should automatically handle the PR submission to the registry.

`1BDO` later confirmed a pull request was opened, linking to [#218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/218).

### Rate Limiting and API Usage for Plugins
Discussion on [#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/40) continued with `ChuXo` reporting the implementation of a rate limiter to prevent exceeding the monthly read limit for posts, specifically for the Free Tier. This aims to address concerns about high API usage at startup.
