## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Enhancing CLI Consistency and Test Reliability
Discussions continued on [#5218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5218) regarding inconsistent `bun run test` behavior across packages. @ai16z-demirix confirmed they have started working on this issue, making progress on phase 1, and will take care of the complete issue. Similarly, on [#5295](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5295), which aims to standardize CLI input methods using `@clack/prompts`, @Ifechukwudaniel requested assignment to the issue.

### Improving Documentation for Diverse Users
Issue [#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5234) focuses on overhauling documentation to cater to both simple users and developers. @Ifechukwudaniel requested assignment to this issue. @Megamindmaster provided detailed feedback, highlighting challenges faced by non-coders, such as inconsistent environment variable settings across different documentation sources and non-functional example JSON files, emphasizing the need for beginner-friendly resources.

### Streamlining Eliza Agent Deployment
The discussion on [#5244](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5244) revolved around the best ways to deploy custom Eliza agents. @bealers shared their work on "elizify," a project aiming for easy, secure, and reproducible Eliza installations, including a one-click Coolify install and solid `docker compose up` functionality, offering it as a community project. They also referenced an older, more brittle attempt at remote deployment. @wtfsayo suggested Railway and Render as potential platforms.
