## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Character File Size Limit Discussion
Discussions continued on [#5268](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5268), "Can't save character." The latest comment from lalalune at 2025-06-26T18:39:54Z requested an increase in the file size limit to 100MB for characters, along with a regression test to identify and fix the bug.

### User Identity Management
Discussions on [#105](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/105), "Split personality because of username change," continued. 0xCardiE at 2025-06-26T22:50:55Z suggested using GitHub internal IDs as the base for user tracking to handle username changes. META-DREAMER at 2025-06-26T20:51:26Z outlined the complexity of updating the database to link multiple identities to one user, noting that the GitHub username is currently the primary key, which complicates changes and requires handling various edge cases.
