# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Jan 22, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on resolving critical API endpoint issues, ensuring consistent data availability and improving the overall robustness of the registry's data pipelines. Key fixes addressed 404 errors for API index, contributor profiles, and overall summaries on days with no activity.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### API Endpoint Reliability Improvements
Significant progress was made in ensuring the reliability of various API endpoints. A fix was implemented to dynamically detect the `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines.yml` workflow, resolving 404 errors for the `/api/index.json` and contributor profile endpoints. This ensures that all 1,433 contributor profiles are correctly generated and accessible. Additionally, the system was updated to generate "no activity recorded" summaries for days without repository activity, preventing 404 errors for overall summary API endpoints and providing consistent API behavior.

### API Data Export Fixes
Two critical issues related to API data exports were resolved today. The first issue, [#225](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/225), addressed the problem where the API index and contributor profiles were not being exported due to a missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow. This has been fixed by adding dynamic `SITE_URL` detection. The second issue, [#226](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/226), resolved the problem of overall summaries not being generated for days with no repository activity, which led to 404 errors. The system now generates a "No activity recorded" summary for such days, ensuring consistent API responses.
