# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, a new plugin for self-sovereign identity with the Nuggets platform was added to the registry. Discussions continued on a previously closed issue regarding documentation, and a new issue was opened concerning a module not found error in the CLI.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **New Plugin Integration**
    *   Added the "nuggets" plugin, enabling self-sovereign identity interaction and data verification with the Nuggets platform. ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/236))
    *   Ensured the new plugin's entry in `index.json` matches the expected naming convention.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
 - None

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   None

## NEW ISSUES

*   **CLI Module Resolution Error**
    *   A new issue reports a "Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'" error when running `elizaos --version` after CLI installation. ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6088))
    *   Initial investigation suggests a bundling issue in the published npm package, preventing the module from being resolved at runtime despite being a listed dependency.
    *   A workaround involves using the CLI from a local clone of the repository.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Plugin Documentation Inaccuracies** ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6070))
    *   The discussion continued regarding the previously closed issue about incorrect plugin documentation and scaffolding problems.
    *   A user expressed significant frustration with the framework's documentation and functionality, stating they spent a week trying to use it and ultimately moved to another framework.
    *   `yungalgo` engaged with the frustrated user, seeking more specific details about their environment (Mac/PC, model provider, database) and offering to dedicate time to understand their challenges.
    *   `yungalgo` also clarified that as an open-source project, there might not always be 1:1 parity between the codebase and documentation at all times.
