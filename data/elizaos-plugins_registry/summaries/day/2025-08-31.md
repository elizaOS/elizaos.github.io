# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Aug 31, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on expanding the plugin registry with new entries. A new plugin for Vercel AI Gateway was added, significantly broadening access to AI models. An existing plugin entry was also updated to ensure consistency within the registry.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Plugin Registry Expansion
The registry was updated with a new entry for `plugin-vercel-ai-gateway`, providing access to over 100 AI models via Vercel AI Gateway. This addition enhances the framework's capabilities by integrating a wide range of AI services. ([#213](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/213))

### Registry Data Consistency
An update was made to `index.json` for `plugin-hedera` to ensure the JSON entry's left side matches the potential NPM package name, adhering to registry standards. ([#212](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/212))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### V3 Goals and Streaming Functionality
Discussion on [#4720](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4720) (V3 Goals) and [#5060](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5060) (Add optional Stream responses to handle streaming) continued with a focus on streaming capabilities. A user inquired about the status of streaming functionality, noting its importance for reducing response latency. Another user confirmed they had implemented streaming support by modifying core files, leveraging existing Eliza AI package capabilities for conditional responses, though this is not an official solution. The conversation highlights the community's interest and ongoing efforts in improving real-time interaction with AI models.

### Discord Image Generation Issues
Issue [#5809](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5809) (Image Generation not working in Discord) saw further comments. A user confirmed that image generation works in the web UI but not in Discord, despite having correct permissions. They noted that the bot returns a text description of the image but no actual image in Discord, and relevant logs for image generation are only present when using the web UI. This suggests a specific integration or permission issue within the Discord plugin rather than a core image generation problem.
