### Registry Plugin Updates
A bug was fixed where the token metrics plugin was referencing an outdated organization namespace. The package name in `index.json` was updated from `@token-metrics` to `@token-metrics-ai` to correctly point to the updated GitHub organization. This ensures the registry accurately reflects the current package location. [#232](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/232)
