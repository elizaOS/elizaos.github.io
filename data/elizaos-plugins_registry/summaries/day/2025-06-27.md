## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Webhook Integration for Plugins
Discussion continued on issue [#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6), which explores providing an option for webhooks to initiate new messages, as an alternative to polling. The latest comment from wtfsayo confirms that plugins can mount routes to the ElizaOS server, making webhook implementation feasible without significant complexity. This suggests a path forward for improving user experience and reducing the cost associated with frequent polling.
