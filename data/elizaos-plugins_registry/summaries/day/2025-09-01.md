# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Sep 1, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a critical bug fix in the registry's version compatibility detection, ensuring accurate plugin classification. Discussions also continued on refactoring the Eliza CLI and addressing a project creation error.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Registry Compatibility Fix**
    *   Resolved an issue where the registry misclassified plugin versions by switching from point satisfaction to semantic version range intersection for compatibility detection ([#214](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/214)).
    *   Ensures v0 compatibility intersects with `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0` and v1 with `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`.

## NEW ISSUES
*   **CLI Refactoring Initiative**
    *   A new issue was opened to discuss refactoring the Eliza CLI to reduce complexity and delegate logic to project directories, aiming for a more streamlined and efficient command-line interface ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5860)).
*   **Project Creation Errors**
    *   An issue was reported regarding a "path not found" error when attempting to create a new project, indicating a potential problem with module resolution or file paths during the project scaffolding process ([#5856](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5856)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Image Generation not working in Discord** ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5809))
    The discussion on this issue, concerning images not appearing in Discord despite working in the web UI, saw a new comment indicating that the problem has been fixed in a related PR ([elizaOS/eliza#5861](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5861)). Earlier comments provided extensive troubleshooting steps, including checking Discord bot permissions (Embed Links, Attach Files, Send Messages), verifying bot setup and environment variables, ensuring proper plugin loading, and debugging logs. The user confirmed permissions were correct and noted the issue only occurred in Discord, not the web UI.

*   **Refactor Eliza CLI** ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5860))
    This newly opened issue generated significant discussion regarding the proposed refactoring of the Eliza CLI. Key points include a proposition to separate responsibilities: a `@eliza/server` package for agent lifecycle, plugin loading, database, and character management, and a streamlined `@eliza/cli` for delegation and remote control. There's agreement on moving logic out of the CLI but caution about moving too much into individual projects. A detailed progress update was shared, outlining completed architectural changes (autonomous starter projects, CLI delegation, argument passthrough) and a restructured project starter. The next steps involve auditing and migrating tests to align with the new architecture.
