## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Custom Plugin Callback Interference**
    Discussion on [#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947) continued, focusing on a bug where a custom plugin's action callback is being replaced by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider. A user `tcm390` suggested checking for existing `GENERATE_IMAGE` actions in the bootstrap and potentially removing them to prevent conflicts. Previously, `claude` had identified the root cause in `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/index.ts` (lines 606-620), where the `ATTACHMENTS` provider modifies the state before it's passed to action callbacks. `claude` also proposed a fix to separate provider state composition from action callback processing and confirmed the issue's validity in the current codebase (v1.0.19).

*   **Twitter Client Initialization Error**
    Issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31) saw continued reports of the Twitter client initialization error. `joaoCarvalho1000` reported experiencing the same issue. Earlier, `RolandOne` mentioned that `plugin-twitter` version 1.0.14 should fix the initial error but introduced a new memory-related error. `Ovodo` expressed concern about the inability to run agents autonomously on Twitter and sought suggestions, noting that older ElizaOS methods worked. `nccuong-vikki` speculated that the issue might be related to limitations of free Twitter API subscriptions.
