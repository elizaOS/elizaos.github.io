## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Custom Plugin Callback Interference
Discussion continued on [#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947), where a custom plugin's action callback is being replaced by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider. A potential fix was proposed and implemented by Claude on July 13th, separating provider state composition from action callback processing to ensure actions use the original clean state. Today, `tcm390` followed up, asking for confirmation if the issue persists and suggesting checking for existing `GENERATE_IMAGE` actions in `plugin-bootstrap` that might be overriding the custom one.

### Twitter Client Initialization Error
Issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31) regarding Twitter client initialization errors saw a new comment today from `joaoCarvalho1000` indicating they are experiencing the same problem. Previous comments from `RolandOne` (July 7th) suggested that `plugin-twitter` version 1.0.14 should fix the initial error, but introduced a new memory insertion error. `Ovodo` (July 3rd) questioned if this means autonomous Twitter agents are currently unfeasible, while `nccuong-vikki` (July 3rd) speculated it might be due to limitations of free Twitter API subscriptions.
