# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Jun 19, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on registry maintenance, specifically updating plugin repository locations. A long-standing bug related to plugin action callbacks was closed, and a new feature request for customizable logger configuration was opened and is being actively discussed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Registry Maintenance and Updates:**
    *   Updated `index.json` to reflect the migration of repositories from `notorious-d-e-v` to `payai` GitHub organizations, ensuring the registry accurately points to the correct plugin locations ([#172](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/172)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

*   A new pull request, [#178](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/178), was opened to update the `plugin-cardano` repository.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Plugin Callback Bug Resolution:**
    *   The issue where callbacks from plugin actions were not reaching the end-user response in chat has been closed ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5017)). This bug affected the expected follow-up messages for transaction success/failure, particularly with `plugin-evm`.

## NEW ISSUES

*   **Logger Configuration Customization:**
    *   A new feature request, [#5183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5183), was opened to allow downstream projects to customize the root logger configuration. This aims to enable projects to modify transports and other logger behaviors beyond just creating child loggers.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Callback from plugin action not making it to end user response in chat ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5017)):**
    *   The issue was closed today after confirmation from `jonathanprozzi` that a fresh start with the updated CLI resolved the `plugin-evm` related response issues. `0xbbjoker` confirmed the closure and offered further assistance for `MCP` related issues. Earlier discussions involved `alex-nax` providing a hotfix workaround and `wtfsayo` noting related issues with callback passing and action response order. The core problem was that a placeholder function was being passed instead of the proper callback during action processing.
*   **Allow Downstream Projects to Customize Root Logger Configuration ([#5183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5183)):**
    *   This newly opened issue is a feature request to enable downstream projects to customize the root logger, including transports, which is currently not possible. `standujar` has taken ownership of the issue. `claude` has provided a detailed analysis and implementation plan, outlining steps to design a delayed initialization system, create a logger configuration interface, implement project-level config loading, and update the CLI. `claude` has also indicated that the implementation is complete, providing usage examples for dedicated config files, project module exports, and `package.json` configuration, highlighting benefits like backward compatibility and full customization. `wtfsayo` prompted `claude` to look into the issue.
