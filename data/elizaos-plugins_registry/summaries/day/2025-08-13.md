### Critical Plugin Publishing Failure Diagnosis
Discussion on [#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5754) provided a detailed diagnosis and solution for the "Critical: Plugin Publishing Fails with False Success Reports" issue. The core problems identified were:
- **Scoped Package Name Issue:** The use of scoped package names (e.g., `@elizaos/plugin-polygon`) without the corresponding npm organization or publish access leads to 404 errors during `npm publish`.
- **Outdated Plugin Template:** The plugin in question was likely created with an older template, lacking the correct structure and configuration for successful publishing.

A suggested fix was provided, advising users to:
1. Update their `package.json` to use an unscoped package name (e.g., `plugin-polygon`).
2. Ensure their `package.json` matches the current plugin template structure, recommending creating a fresh plugin to compare.
3. Re-attempt publishing after these changes. The current template has been confirmed to work smoothly for publishing.
