## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Critical Plugin Publishing Failure Investigation
Discussion continued on the critical issue where the `elizaos publish --npm` command reports success despite the plugin not being published to npm due to a 404 error ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5754)). The latest comment from yungalgo provided a detailed analysis and suggested fixes. The core problems identified are:
- **Scoped Package Name Issue:** The user's package name (`@elizaos/plugin-polygon`) is scoped, requiring the `@elizaos` organization to exist on npm and for the user to have publish access, which is likely not the case, leading to a 404.
- **Outdated Plugin Template:** The user's plugin was created with an older template, which might lack the correct structure and configuration for successful publishing.

Suggested solutions include updating the package name to be unscoped (e.g., `plugin-polygon`) and ensuring the `package.json` matches the current plugin template structure. A test confirmed that publishing works smoothly with the current template and an unscoped package name.
