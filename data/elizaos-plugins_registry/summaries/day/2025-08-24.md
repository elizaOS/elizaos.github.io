## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Agent Knowledge Retrieval Challenges
Discussions continued on [#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/14), where users are experiencing issues with agents not responding with knowledge from ingested documents. A new comment from `bbsdevcollab` on August 24, 2025, confirms the problem, stating that despite successful document ingestion with one fragment, the agent fails to respond with knowledge even when questions are phrased similarly to the document content. This echoes earlier reports from `0xRabbidfly` and `matteo-brandolino`, indicating a persistent problem with RAG context awareness.

### Token Metrics Plugin Integration
On [#202](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/202), `wtfsayo` commented on August 24, 2025, requesting a pull request for the Token Metrics Plugin, suggesting checking recently merged PRs for guidance. This indicates progress towards integrating a comprehensive cryptocurrency analysis plugin with 20 Token Metrics API endpoints and AI-powered insights.
