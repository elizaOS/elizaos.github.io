# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today saw significant progress with the introduction of a comprehensive billing system, enhanced chat responsiveness, a new documentation UI, and an architecture for anonymous user support.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Billing and Payments System
A full Stripe-backed billing subsystem was implemented, including four new database tables for customers, payment methods, invoices, and transactions. Six new backend API routes were added for managing customer, payment, top-up, invoice, and transaction operations. The frontend now features a complete billing page with overview, one-time and auto top-up, payment method management, invoices, and transaction history components. [#6123](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6123)

### Container Billing Logic
A complete automated monthly container billing system was introduced. This includes new database schemas for user accounts, container deployments, billing transactions, and schedules. A `BillingService` was added to handle cron jobs, payment processing, and a 7-day grace period for failed payments, along with email notifications and automatic container deletion. [#6124](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6124)

### Enhanced Chat Performance and Reliability
Significant improvements were made to Eliza chat responsiveness. This involved adding a `ModelPerformanceMonitor` for real-time tracking, implementing per-model timeouts and exponential retry wrappers, and integrating fast model providers like Groq and Kimi. Comprehensive documentation was also added for model configuration and performance troubleshooting. [#6127](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6127)

### New Documentation UI and API Explorer
A new public `/docs` UI was built, featuring an OpenAI-style API explorer, character setup guides, and an overview of the cloud architecture. This includes interactive endpoint testing, multi-language code examples, and detailed configuration instructions. [#6128](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6128)

### Anonymous User and Free Inference Architecture
An architecture document was created detailing support for anonymous users and a free inference tier. This plan includes a 4-tier user system, quota management, new database tables for anonymous users and inference quotas, a `QuotaService`, and middleware for user identification and quota enforcement. [#6131](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6131)

### Voice Infrastructure Development
A comprehensive voice infrastructure was implemented, featuring browser-based voice generation for client-side TTS, optional server voice endpoints for premium users (supporting OpenAI and ElevenLabs), and integration for generating embeddings from voice transcriptions. [#6130](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6130)

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Where did packages/docs/ go?** ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6122)): The user is inquiring about the relocation of the `packages/docs/` directory. CodeRabbit AI has auto-generated an issue plan, noting that its agent's plans did not produce any file changes related to this query.

- **Billing Page & Stripe Integration** ([#6123](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6123)): This issue outlines the implementation of a comprehensive billing page with Stripe integration. CodeRabbit AI has provided a detailed plan, including the creation of four new database tables (`customers`, `payment_methods`, `invoices`, `transactions`), six backend API routers for customer, payment, top-up, invoice, and transaction operations, and a TypeScript API client. On the frontend, seven new components for the billing page, overview, one-time and auto top-ups, payment methods, invoices, and transaction history have been added. The plan also includes Stripe environment keys, migrations, and documentation.

- **Container Billing Logic** ([#6124](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6124)): This issue details the implementation of a complete container billing system. CodeRabbit AI's plan includes adding a new database schema for billing, a `BillingService` for cron jobs, payment processing, and grace period management, and billing-related types. REST API endpoints for billing management, along with documentation and migrations, are also part of the plan. The system will handle monthly cron deductions, container pausing on payment failure, a one-week retention period, email notifications, and automatic deletion.

- **Analytics** ([#6125](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6125)): This issue focuses on implementing analytics to show usage metrics for models and services. CodeRabbit AI's plan involves creating a new analytics API with three endpoints (`/api/agents/:agentId/analytics`, `/models`, `/services`) that support time-range, limit, and type filters. The implementation will aggregate in-memory metrics for models, services, containers, chat, and media, and include documentation for the new API.

- **Authentication & Login System** ([#6126](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6126)): This issue addresses the development of a full login page with OAuth integration and a `redirectTo` parameter. CodeRabbit AI's plan includes adding TypeScript types, OAuth configuration, JWT utilities, and an authentication service. Database migrations for users, OAuth accounts, and sessions are also part of the plan, along with updating authentication middleware and creating a new frontend login page.

- **Eliza Chat** ([#6127](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6127)): This issue aims to debug and finalize agent chat responsiveness. CodeRabbit AI's plan outlines a performance overhaul, including a `ModelPerformanceMonitor` with per-model timeouts and exponential retry wrappers. Integration of fast providers like Groq and Kimi, real-time logging, and enhanced documentation for model configuration and troubleshooting are also included.

- **Plugin-Cloud Testing** ([#6129](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6129)): This issue focuses on testing the `plugin-cloud` within the Eliza Framework. CodeRabbit AI's plan involves adding four new test files for CLI commands (`deploy`, `containers`, `login`) and integration tests for cloud documentation. These tests will cover option validation, data structures, error handling, authentication flows, and documentation consistency.

- **Voice Infrastructure** ([#6130](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6130)): This issue addresses the development of voice infrastructure. CodeRabbit AI's plan includes adding client-side browser TTS, server-side premium TTS endpoints, and integration for generating embeddings from voice transcriptions. Documentation for the voice infrastructure and API client updates are also part of the plan.

- **Support Tasks** ([#6131](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6131)): This issue involves collaborating on anonymous ID and free inference architecture. CodeRabbit AI has provided a detailed architecture document outlining a 4-tier user system, quota management, new database tables for anonymous users and inference quotas, a `QuotaService`, and middleware for user identification and quota enforcement. Frontend fingerprinting and API client updates are also included in the plan.
