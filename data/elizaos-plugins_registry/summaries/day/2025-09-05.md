No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

- **Agent Won't Respond to Twitter Mentions:** Discussion continues on this issue ([#4921](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4921)). The latest comment from `standujar` asks if the issue persists for `@CurralesDragon`, following a previous suggestion by `0xbbjoker` to update the CLI and `plugin-twitter` version.
- **Build Failure in @elizaos/core:** This issue ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5738)) regarding a `bun run clean` failure due to TypeScript errors is being investigated. `standujar` reported being unable to reproduce the issue, suggesting it might be fixed, following `jkbrooks`'s inquiry about its resolution.
- **Plugin Not Visible in PR After Publish:** The issue of a published plugin not appearing in a pull request ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5813)) is still active. `1BDO` provided a link to a comparison, and `yungalgo` suggested a commit to change the plugin name from "plugin-delta" to "@1BDO/plugin-delta" due to a bug in scoping npm packages. This follows previous detailed discussion about the publishing process and the use of the `--npm` flag.
