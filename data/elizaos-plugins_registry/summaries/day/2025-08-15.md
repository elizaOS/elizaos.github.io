## CLOSED ISSUES

**Plugin Publishing Reliability**
The issue where the `elizaos publish --npm` command reported success but failed to publish was resolved. The solution involved updating the package name to remove the `@elizaos` scope and ensuring the `package.json` matched the current plugin template structure. ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5754))

**Plugin Testing Guidance**
Guidance was provided for a developer encountering consistent test failures related to WebSocket mocks. The resolution involved ensuring mock setup occurred before imports and using consistent mocking libraries. ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5770))

## NEW ISSUES

**New Plugin Proposal**
A new issue was opened to propose the "Token Metrics Plugin," a comprehensive cryptocurrency analysis plugin leveraging 20 Token Metrics API endpoints and AI-powered insights. ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/202))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Plugin Testing Guidance ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5770))**
The latest comment from `1BDO` confirms that moving the WebSocket mock setup before imports successfully resolved the persistent test errors, allowing the service to use the mock instead of attempting real connections. The user also expressed satisfaction with Eliza's "ASK AI" documentation.

**Critical: Plugin Publishing Fails with False Success Reports ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5754))**
The issue was successfully resolved, as confirmed by `monilpat` in the latest comment. The key to the fix was the legacy plugin naming change, specifically removing the `@elizaos` scope from the package name and aligning the `package.json` with the current plugin template. `yungalgo` had previously provided detailed steps for this resolution.
