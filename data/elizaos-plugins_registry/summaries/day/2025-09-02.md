### Eliza CLI Refactoring Discussion
Discussion continued on [#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5860) regarding the refactoring of the Eliza CLI. The core idea is to streamline the CLI to handle only configuration and delegate execution, moving complex logic into project directories and a new `@eliza/server` package.

Key points from today's discussion:
- **Progress Update:** A detailed progress update was provided on September 1st, outlining the architecture and delegation phases, including autonomous starter projects, CLI delegation, argument passthrough, and stdio inheritance. The project starter has been restructured into "Full" and "Minimal" flavors.
- **Division of Responsibilities:** There's an ongoing debate about where responsibilities should lie. `standujar` proposed a clear distinction: `@eliza/server` for agent lifecycle, plugin loading, database, and character management; `@eliza/cli` for remote control and output; and starter projects for composition roots.
- **Concerns about Project-Level Logic:** `odilitime` expressed concern about moving too much logic into projects, fearing the need to sync groups of functions across different projects. `wtfsayo` suggested replicating the Mintlify CLI model where the CLI runs the server, and the `start` command wraps server initialization options.
- **Latest Comments:** `standujar` restarted from a clean slate today, and `wtfsayo` agreed with the proposed changes as long as projects require minimal modifications. `standujar` also linked to [#5864](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5864), indicating further related work.
