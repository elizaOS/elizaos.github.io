### Eliza CLI Refactoring Discussion
Discussion continued on [#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5860) regarding the refactoring of the Eliza CLI. The latest comments indicate ongoing progress and refinement of the proposed architecture.

- **Latest Updates:** `standujar` provided an update on September 2nd at 16:08:40Z, referencing `#5864`, and at 08:52:23Z, stating "Restarting from clean!".
- **Architectural Proposals:** `standujar` proposed a clear distinction of responsibilities: a `@eliza/server` package for agent lifecycle, plugin loading, database, and character management, and a streamlined `@eliza/cli` for delegation and remote control. Starter projects would handle composition roots.
- **Community Feedback:** `wtfsayo` agreed with the general direction, suggesting a model similar to Mintlify CLI where the `start` command wraps server initialization. `odilitime` expressed caution about moving logic "into projects" if it leads to duplicated function groups across projects, to which `standujar` requested examples for clarification.
- **Progress Report:** On September 1st, `standujar` provided a detailed progress update, outlining completed phases (autonomous starter, CLI delegation, argument passthrough, stdio inheritance) and a restructured project starter. The end-to-end workflow for `elizaos create` and `elizaos start` is reported to be working smoothly.
- **Next Steps:** The immediate focus is on auditing and migrating tests, ensuring proper delegation, template structure, mode switching, and cleaning up outdated tests.
