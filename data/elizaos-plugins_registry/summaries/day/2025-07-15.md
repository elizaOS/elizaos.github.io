## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Twitter API Rate Limit Issues ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38))
Discussions continued regarding the "Too Many Requests" error when fetching the Home timeline, even with `search enabled` set to false. Users are experiencing 429 API limit errors. The latest comments indicate that the issue persists even with version 1.2.16, which was supposed to have a new system for timeline fetching. The conversation has shifted to the necessity of a paid Twitter API subscription (Basic tier, costing $200/month) to mitigate rate limits, with a user inquiring about the specific rate limit for this tier.
