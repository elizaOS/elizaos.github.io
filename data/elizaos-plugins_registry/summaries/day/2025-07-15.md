## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Twitter API Rate Limit and Timeline Fetching Issues
Discussions continued on the issue of "Failed to fetch Home timeline" ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38)), which is causing 429 API limit errors even when `search enabled` is false. Users are experiencing "Too Many Requests" errors despite being on version 1.2.16, which was supposed to include a new system for timeline fetching. The core of the discussion revolves around the Twitter API subscription tiers, with clarification that the "Basic" tier (costing $200/month) is required to avoid these rate limits, unlike the free tier. A user inquired about the specific rate limit for the $200 tier.
