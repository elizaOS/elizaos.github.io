An issue concerning an agent not providing a reply when using the Google API was closed.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Google API Agent Reply Issue
Issue [#5664](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5664) saw active discussion today, leading to its resolution. Initially, there was a misunderstanding about the existence of the `@elizaos/plugin-google-genai` plugin, which was quickly corrected. The core problem was identified as the agent receiving messages but not generating responses, pointing to an issue with the `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`. Users were advised to ensure the API key was correctly set in their environment variables. It was also noted that `bootstrap` and `sql` plugins are mandatory. The user confirmed the solution worked.
