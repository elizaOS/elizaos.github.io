## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Google API Plugin Not Responding ([#5664](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5664))
This issue, opened by user `1BDO`, reported that their ElizaOS agent was not responding when using the Google API. Initial diagnostics by `claude` incorrectly suggested the `@elizaos/plugin-google-genai` plugin did not exist. However, `wtfsayo` corrected this, confirming the plugin's existence. The discussion then focused on the actual root cause: the `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` being unset or incorrect. `claude` provided a comprehensive solution, including steps to obtain and set the API key, and suggested using `LOG_LEVEL=debug elizaos dev` for further debugging. `wtfsayo` also noted that the free Google API might be unreliable. The issue was ultimately resolved with `1BDO` confirming the fix.
