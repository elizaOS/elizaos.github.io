# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Jun 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on expanding the plugin registry with a new entry and addressing an issue related to the `elizaos update` command.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Plugin Registry Expansion
- A new plugin, "kudo," was added to the registry, expanding the available functionalities for ElizaOS agents. This involved updating `generated-registry.json` and `index.json` to include the new plugin's details, ensuring proper naming conventions and GitHub repository references. ([#179](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/179))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### CLI Update Mechanism Resolution
- The issue where `elizaos update` failed to correctly update the CLI version was closed. The resolution clarifies that users should use `bun install -g @elizaos/cli@latest` for initial updates, which then enables the correct update command for future versions. ([#5198](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5198))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Web Client Version Discrepancy
- **[#4924](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4924) Web client thinks it is on a different version**: The discussion on this issue indicates that the problem of the web client displaying an incorrect version (e.g., `v1.0.3` instead of `v1.0.4`) and requesting updates might be resolved. A comment from `standujar` on June 20, 2025, suggests that the issue is no longer reproducible. Earlier comments highlighted concerns about the web client spamming the GitHub API, leading to 429 errors and memory consumption, and causing infinite renders and freezing.

### Checking Loaded Plugins
- **[#4931](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4931) How to check currently loaded plugins in the agent**: On June 20, 2025, `standujar` provided guidance on how to verify loaded plugins. Users should look for a log entry similar to `{"level":30,"time":1750453287621,"pid":963,"hostname":"e3f0032a71d9","msg":"Final plugins being loaded: @elizaos/plugin-sql, bootstrap, pdf, openai, mcp, knowledge, discord, slack"}` to confirm which plugins are active.
