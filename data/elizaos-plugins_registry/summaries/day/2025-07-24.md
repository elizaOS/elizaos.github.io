## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Logger Compatibility with Bun
The issue [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5673) was opened to address `pino-pretty` errors in export builds from Bun, proposing to replace `pino` with `adze`. The latest comment from "claude" indicates that the migration from `pino` to `adze` is code-complete. This includes updating dependencies, implementing an `ElizaLogger` class with a pino-compatible API, preserving custom log levels and environment variable support, and maintaining server API compatibility. The next steps involve running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build` to fully verify the migration.
