### Logger Compatibility for Bun Builds
The issue [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5673) highlights a problem with `pino-pretty` causing errors in export builds from Bun. The proposed solution is to replace `pino` with `adze` for better compatibility. Claude has completed the code migration, replacing `pino` and `pino-pretty` with `adze` and creating an `ElizaLogger` class that maintains a pino-compatible API. The migration preserves custom log levels, in-memory buffering, environment variable configuration, and Sentry integration. Next steps involve running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build` to verify the changes.
