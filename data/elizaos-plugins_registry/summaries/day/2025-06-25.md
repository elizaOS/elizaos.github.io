### Plugin Configuration and Agent Response
Issue [#5279](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5279), "No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING," was closed today. The resolution involved ensuring the agent character file included the `openai` plugin, which resolved the `TEXT_EMBEDDING` error and allowed the agent to reply successfully.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Custom Plugin Development Challenges
Issue [#5260](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5260), "Create custom plugin for onchain AI agent," continues to be active. The original poster, yehia67, reported difficulties with Eliza as an agent only supporting one message before stopping plugin usage, and also noted that agent replies sometimes appear in the terminal but not on the interface logs. omariosman echoed similar experiences with errors during custom plugin development. The latest comment from wtfsayo suggests that the issue might be related to sending responses via both callback and return in the action, advising to use only one method.

### Twitter Plugin Functionality
Issues [#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/26), "Newlines in timeline replies are replaced with \\n\\n instead of actual line breaks," and [#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/29), "Twitter plugin not posting replies to mentions or tags," remain active. For [#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/26), gnomonprime identified that the `plugin-twitter` template explicitly instructs the agent to use `\\n\\n` for newlines, causing the literal text to appear instead of actual line breaks. Regarding [#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/29), gnomonprime observed similar behavior where memories are saved but responses are not delivered, suggesting it might be a random occurrence also seen in the web UI.
