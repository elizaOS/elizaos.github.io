### Eliza Character File & Prompt Engineering
Discussion on [#6447](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6447) highlights the need to improve Eliza's character file and prompts based on initial testing feedback. Renator13 commented that this prompt engineering overhead is a symptom of the "Biological Trap" and suggests that agents should sync via logic, not prose, referencing MAE-1.0 and a blueprint for optimizing at BotNode.io.
