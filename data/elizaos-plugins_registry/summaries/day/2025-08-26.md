# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Aug 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the `elizaos-plugins/registry` repository saw significant enhancements in automation and data consistency, with the addition of alphabetical sorting for registry generation and robust Claude Code review workflows. A new plugin was also added to the registry.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Registry Generation and Consistency
The registry generation process was improved by implementing alphabetical sorting for entries, ensuring consistent ordering of the final output. This change affects `index.json` and `scripts/generate-registry.js`. ([#207](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/207))

### Automated Code Review with Claude AI
Two new GitHub Actions workflows were introduced to integrate Claude Code for automated code reviews. The initial setup for Claude Code was added, followed by an enhancement to provide comprehensive validation for plugin registry contributions, including NPM package validation. ([#206](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/206), [#208](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/208))

### Plugin Registry Expansion
A new plugin, "polymarket," was successfully added to the registry, expanding the available plugins within the ElizaOS ecosystem. ([#205](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/205))
