## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Registry Generation and Consistency
The registry generation process was improved by adding alphabetical sorting for entries and the final output, ensuring consistent ordering. This involved changes to `index.json` and `scripts/generate-registry.js`. ([#207](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/207))

### Advanced Code Review Automation
The repository integrated and subsequently enhanced the Claude Code review workflow. This enhancement includes comprehensive validation for plugin registry contributions, such as verifying NPM packages using `npm view`. These updates are reflected in `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` and `.github/workflows/claude.yml`. ([#208](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/208), [#206](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/206))

### New Plugin Addition
The "polymarket" plugin was added to the registry, following the established registry update checklist. ([#205](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/205))
