# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw a significant feature addition to the registry generation script, improving its robustness by detecting and warning about package version and core dependency mismatches, and correctly setting `supports` flags. Additionally, a new issue was opened and closed, focusing on extending the static JSON API to include summary endpoints.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Registry Generation Logic
*   The registry generation script was improved to detect and warn about mismatches between package versions and core dependencies.
*   The script now correctly sets `supports` flags based on actual core dependencies, rather than package versions, enhancing accuracy and reliability. ([#244](https://github.elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/244))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### JSON API Endpoints for Summaries
A new feature request to extend the static JSON API to include summary endpoints was opened and subsequently closed today. The discussion involved refining the approach to piggyback JSON generation alongside markdown, enhancing the response shape with fields like `contentHash` and `sourceLastUpdated`, and defining various dated and latest pointer endpoints. The implementation plan focused on modifying existing summary generation scripts to write JSON alongside markdown and adding utility functions for content hashing and updating latest/index files. ([#185](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/185))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### JSON API Endpoints for Summaries ([#185](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/185))
The discussion on this issue, which was opened and closed today, centered around the implementation of JSON API endpoints for summaries. Key points from the comments include:
*   **Refined Approach:** The initial plan was refined based on data engineering feedback, deciding to generate JSON alongside markdown during the `summarize` command rather than a separate export step. The volume of data was deemed manageable for full exports, and an `export-summaries` command would be kept for backfilling.
*   **Enhanced Response Shape:** A detailed `SummaryAPIResponse` interface was proposed, including fields like `version`, `type`, `interval`, `date`, `generatedAt`, `sourceLastUpdated`, `contentFormat`, `contentHash`, and `entity` details.
*   **Endpoint Structure:** Specific dated endpoints for overall, repository, and contributor summaries were outlined, along with "latest" pointers and index files for easier access.
*   **Implementation Changes:** The plan involved modifying existing summary generation scripts (`generateOverallSummary.ts` and equivalents) to write JSON, and adding an `apiHelpers.ts` file for shared utilities like `sha256`, `buildSummaryResponse`, `writeLatestPointer`, and `updateIndex`.
*   **DRY Recommendation:** A comment emphasized reusing existing utilities like `fsHelpers.ts`, `date-utils.ts`, and pipeline utilities, while identifying truly missing components like `sha256()`, `getContributorSummaryFilePath()`, `getAPIFilePath()`, `writeLatestPointer()`, `updateIndex()`, and specific type definitions. It was recommended to extend `fsHelpers.ts` rather than creating a new `apiHelpers.ts`.
*   **Resolution:** The issue was closed with a "merged" comment, indicating the successful implementation of the discussed features.
