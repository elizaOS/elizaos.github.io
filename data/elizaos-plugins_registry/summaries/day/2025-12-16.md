## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### New Plugin Integration
A new feature was added to integrate `plugin-farcaster-local-hub` ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)). This plugin enables self-hosted Farcaster functionality using a local Snapchain/Hubble hub, removing dependencies on Neynar or other external APIs.
