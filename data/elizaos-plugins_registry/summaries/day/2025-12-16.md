# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Dec 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on expanding the plugin ecosystem with the addition of a self-hosted Farcaster plugin, enabling local Snapchain/Hubble hub integration without external API dependencies.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### New Farcaster Plugin for Local Hub Integration
A new feature was introduced to add a self-hosted Farcaster plugin, `plugin-farcaster-local-hub`. This plugin allows for local Snapchain/Hubble hub integration, eliminating dependencies on external APIs like Neynar. It also includes fixes for the Farcaster timestamp epoch and the `reverse=true` parameter in the Hub API for retrieving recent data. ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243))
