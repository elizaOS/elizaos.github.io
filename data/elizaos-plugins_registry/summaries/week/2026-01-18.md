# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jan 18 - 24, 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week, development focused on hardening the registry's infrastructure and expanding the ecosystem's capabilities through new integrations. The primary technical achievement was the resolution of critical API data pipeline failures that previously caused 404 errors for contributor profiles and daily summaries. By implementing dynamic environment detection and fallback mechanisms for low-activity periods, the registry now provides a more robust and consistent data source for downstream consumers. Additionally, the plugin ecosystem continues to grow with the introduction of high-performance compute and real-time data integrations.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### API Infrastructure & Data Reliability
The core focus of the week was ensuring the reliability of the registry's data exports. Significant updates were made to the automated workflows to ensure consistent API behavior regardless of repository activity levels.
*   **Dynamic Site Detection:** Implemented dynamic `SITE_URL` detection within the `run-pipelines.yml` workflow. This fix ensures that the API index and all 1,433 contributor profiles are correctly generated and accessible, resolving previous 404 errors ([#225](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/225)).
*   **Activity Fallbacks:** Updated the system to generate "No activity recorded" summaries for days without repository updates. This prevents API breaks and ensures that the overall summary endpoints return valid responses even during quiet periods ([#226](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/226)).

### Plugin Ecosystem Expansion
The registry continues to move toward a more modular and composable architecture by integrating new specialized plugins:
*   **Cerebras Integration:** Introduced a new plugin for Cerebras, likely focusing on high-speed inference or compute capabilities ([#249](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/249)).
*   **Sportradar Integration:** Added the `@elizaos/plugin-sportradar`, expanding the framework's utility into real-time sports data and analytics ([#250](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/250)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
The week saw the resolution of critical blockers related to data availability:
*   **API Data Export Fixes:** Resolved issues where missing environment variables prevented the export of the API index and contributor profiles ([#225](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/225)).
*   **Endpoint Consistency:** Fixed 404 errors on summary endpoints by ensuring the system handles "zero-activity" days gracefully ([#226](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/226)).

### New & Active Issues
While no new issues were opened during the latter half of the week, the project maintained a clean slate regarding high-activity discussions, suggesting that the current fixes have stabilized the core registry functions for the time being.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The activity this week reflects a steady cadence of maintenance and growth. The successful generation of over 1,400 contributor profiles highlights the scale of the ElizaOS ecosystem and the importance of the registry in tracking decentralized contributions. The addition of new plugins like Cerebras and Sportradar demonstrates ongoing interest from developers in extending the framework's reach into diverse data domains and specialized hardware environments.
