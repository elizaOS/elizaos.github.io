# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on expanding the plugin ecosystem while actively addressing several key user-facing issues. The primary achievement was the addition of the new `plugin-octav` to the registry, growing the capabilities available to ElizaOS agents. Concurrently, active discussions took place around improving the user experience, including a debate on the clarity of Web UI documentation, the logic for alpha version update notifications, and troubleshooting a persistent SQL database error in the Twitter plugin.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
### Plugin Registry Expansion
The registry was expanded with the addition of a new plugin. A pull request ([#230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/230)) was opened and subsequently completed to add `plugin-octav` to the `index.json` file, making it available within the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
### Closed Issues
No issues were closed this week.

### New & Active Issues
While no new issues were opened, several active discussions highlighted key areas for improvement and troubleshooting:

*   **Update Notifications for Alpha Versions ([#5971](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5971)):** A discussion continued around preventing update notifications for alpha versions from appearing for users on stable channels. While a contributor indicated a willingness to address it, another comment suggested this may have already been fixed, noting the current stable, alpha, and beta version numbers.
*   **Web UI Dashboard Documentation ([#5857](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5857)):** A user report about a lack of documentation for the Web UI dashboard sparked a conversation. A contributor asserted that documentation has been present in the quickstart guide, highlighting a potential need to improve documentation discoverability.
*   **Twitter Plugin SQL Error ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/39)):** Multiple users reported a significant `insert into "memories"` SQL database error when using the Twitter plugin. The community is actively trying to diagnose the problem by gathering specific version information to reproduce the bug.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was evident in both direct contributions and issue discussions. The addition of `plugin-octav` via PR [#230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/230) represents a tangible expansion of the project's ecosystem.
