## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
### New Plugin Integrations
The registry was enhanced with new plugins, expanding the toolset available to ElizaOS agents.

-   **`plugin-coti` Added:** A new plugin, `plugin-coti`, was successfully merged, enabling ElizaOS agents to perform private token operations and encrypted transactions on the COTI blockchain ([#193](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/193)).

-   **Google API Plugin Troubleshooting:** An issue where an agent failed to respond when using the Google API was resolved ([#5664](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5664)).
