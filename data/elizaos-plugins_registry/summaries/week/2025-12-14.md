# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing the project's autonomy and decentralization, a core tenet of the ElizaOS philosophy. The primary achievement was the integration of a new self-hosted Farcaster plugin, which significantly reduces reliance on external, centralized APIs. This addition empowers users with greater control over their data and infrastructure. The remainder of the week was quiet, with no new issues or other pull requests reported.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on expanding the registry's plugin capabilities to support more decentralized configurations.

### New Self-Hosted Farcaster Plugin
A new feature was merged to integrate the `plugin-farcaster-local-hub` ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)). This plugin allows the system to connect to a self-hosted Farcaster hub (Snapchain/Hubble), removing the dependency on third-party services like Neynar. In addition to adding this new capability, the pull request also included important fixes for the Farcaster timestamp epoch and improved data fetching by prioritizing recent data from the Hub API.
