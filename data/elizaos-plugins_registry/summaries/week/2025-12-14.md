# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing the project's decentralization and autonomy, a core tenet of the ElizaOS philosophy. The primary achievement was the integration of a new self-hosted Farcaster plugin, which removes dependencies on external, centralized APIs. This strategic addition empowers users with greater control over their data and infrastructure. The remainder of the week was quiet, with no other development activity or issue triage reported.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The week's efforts were concentrated on expanding the registry's plugin capabilities.

### New Farcaster Plugin for Self-Hosting
A significant new feature was introduced with the integration of the `plugin-farcaster-local-hub` ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)). This plugin allows for self-hosted Farcaster functionality by connecting to a local Snapchain/Hubble hub. This change eliminates the need for third-party services like Neynar, giving users more independence. The update also included a fix for the Farcaster timestamp epoch and ensures that the most recent data is prioritized when querying the Hub API.
