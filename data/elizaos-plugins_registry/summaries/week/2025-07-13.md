# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's progress centered on expanding the plugin ecosystem with the addition of the Mattermost and Bonsai plugins. While the registry grew, significant community effort was directed towards troubleshooting persistent issues in existing plugins. Discussions highlighted ongoing challenges with the Twitter plugin, particularly concerning API rate limits and initialization errors, alongside a deeper investigation into a core bug affecting custom plugin callbacks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary focus of development was on expanding the available tools for the ElizaOS ecosystem.

*   **Plugin Registry Expansion**
    *   The registry was enhanced with two new plugins. The `plugin-mattermost` was added, enabling integration with the Mattermost messaging platform ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)).
    *   Additionally, `plugin-bonsai` was published and verified, making it available for use ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed this week. However, discussions on several critical active issues revealed important insights and potential blockers.

*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved this week.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Twitter Plugin Challenges:** The `plugin-twitter` continues to face significant hurdles. Users are still reporting initialization errors on issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), with speculation that it may be related to free-tier API limitations. A separate but related issue, [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38), concerning "Failed to fetch Home timeline" errors, clarified that the "Too Many Requests" errors persist due to Twitter's API subscription model, likely requiring a paid "Basic" tier to function correctly.
    *   **Custom Plugin Callback Bug:** Discussion continued on [#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947), where a custom plugin's action callback is being overridden. The root cause was previously identified in the `plugin-bootstrap` package, and a community member suggested a potential workaround involving the removal of conflicting `GENERATE_IMAGE` actions during bootstrap to prevent the issue.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was strong this week, primarily focused on collaborative troubleshooting within active issues. Users like `tcm390`, `claude`, `joaoCarvalho1000`, `RolandOne`, `Ovodo`, and `nccuong-vikki` were instrumental in diagnosing problems, sharing experiences, and proposing solutions for the Twitter plugin and the callback interference bug. This activity highlights a healthy, engaged community dedicated to identifying and resolving complex technical challenges within the framework.
