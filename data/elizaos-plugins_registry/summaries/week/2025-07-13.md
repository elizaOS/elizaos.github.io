# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's progress centered on expanding the plugin ecosystem, with the official addition of the Mattermost and Bonsai plugins to the registry. This expansion, however, was contrasted by significant ongoing challenges with the Twitter plugin, where community members collaborated to diagnose persistent initialization errors, memory issues, and API rate limit failures. Discussions also advanced on a critical bug involving custom plugin callback interference, highlighting a focus on both growing the platform's capabilities and ensuring its underlying stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary focus of development was on growing the number of available plugins within the ElizaOS ecosystem.

*   **Plugin Registry Expansion:** Two new plugins were successfully published and added to the registry.
    *   The `plugin-mattermost` was added, expanding the range of supported client integrations ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)).
    *   The `plugin-bonsai` was also published and made available for use ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week. The focus remained on diagnosing and discussing complex active issues, particularly concerning third-party integrations and core plugin behavior.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Twitter Plugin Instability:** A significant amount of discussion occurred across multiple issues related to the Twitter plugin. In issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), users continue to report client initialization errors, with speculation that even recent fixes may introduce new memory insertion problems. A related issue, [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38), saw active discussion around "Too Many Requests" errors when fetching timelines. The community determined these errors are likely tied to the limitations of the free Twitter API tier, as users on paid tiers reported success. These combined issues suggest that creating reliable, autonomous Twitter agents is currently a major challenge.
    *   **Custom Plugin Callback Interference:** Discussion continued in [#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947), where a custom plugin's action is being overridden by a provider. A potential fix was proposed, and follow-up investigation is underway to confirm if conflicting actions in `plugin-bootstrap` might be the root cause.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week saw strong community engagement focused on troubleshooting active issues. The problems with the Twitter plugin ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38)) spurred collaboration among multiple users (`joaoCarvalho1000`, `web-mickey`, `ksaitor`, `ChristopherTrimboli`, and others), who shared error details, version numbers, and API subscription info to collectively diagnose the problem. Similarly, the debugging effort on the callback interference issue ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947)) demonstrated close collaboration between contributors `Claude` and `tcm390`.
