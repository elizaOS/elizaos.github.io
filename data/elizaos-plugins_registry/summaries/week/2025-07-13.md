# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on expanding the plugin ecosystem, with the official addition of the `plugin-mattermost` and `plugin-bonsai` to the registry. This progress in growing our integration capabilities was balanced by significant ongoing discussions aimed at resolving persistent issues within existing plugins. Key challenges under investigation include multiple bugs affecting the Twitter plugin, related to client initialization and API rate limits, as well as a critical issue where custom plugin callbacks are being improperly overridden.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development work this period involved growing the number of available plugins in the registry, enhancing the integration options for the ElizaOS framework.

*   **Plugin Registry Expansion:**
    *   The `plugin-mattermost` was added, expanding the platform's client integration capabilities ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)).
    *   The `plugin-bonsai` was published and added to the registry's index, making it available for use ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened or closed this week based on the provided reports. Triage and discussion centered on critical active issues, particularly concerning third-party integrations and core plugin interactions.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   No issues were closed during this period.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Twitter Plugin Instability:** Discussions continued across multiple issues regarding the `plugin-twitter`. In [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), users confirmed still facing client initialization errors, with a previous fix in v1.0.14 reportedly introducing a new memory insertion error. Separately, in [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38), users on the free Twitter API tier are experiencing "Too Many Requests" errors when fetching timelines, even with the latest plugin version (1.2.16). These combined issues suggest that creating autonomous Twitter agents is currently challenging.
    *   **Custom Plugin Callback Interference:** In issue [#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947), discussion is ongoing about a bug where a custom plugin's action callback is being replaced by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider. A potential fix was proposed, and follow-up investigation is underway to see if conflicting actions in `plugin-bootstrap` might be the root cause.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was most visible in the active issue discussions. Multiple users, including `joaoCarvalho1000`, `ksaitor`, and `web-mickey`, collaborated by confirming they were experiencing the same Twitter-related problems, providing valuable validation for bug reports. Contributors like `tcm390`, `ChristopherTrimboli`, and `Claude` were actively engaged in diagnosing these complex issues, proposing fixes, and guiding users through troubleshooting steps, demonstrating a healthy, collaborative effort to improve plugin stability.
