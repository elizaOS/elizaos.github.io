# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's progress centered on expanding the plugin ecosystem, with the official addition of the Mattermost and Bonsai plugins to the registry. This growth, however, was contrasted by ongoing challenges with existing integrations. Significant community discussion focused on troubleshooting persistent issues with the Twitter plugin, including initialization errors and API rate limits, which are currently hindering the functionality of autonomous agents using the service. Another key discussion involved diagnosing and fixing a bug where a core provider interferes with custom plugin callbacks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary focus of completed work was the expansion of available integrations within the ElizaOS ecosystem.

-   **Plugin Registry Expansion:** Two new plugins were published, increasing the range of tools available to agents.
    -   The `plugin-mattermost` was added, enabling integrations with the Mattermost collaboration platform ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)).
    -   The `plugin-bonsai` was also published to the registry ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week. Discussions were concentrated on several critical active issues, particularly concerning the Twitter integration.

-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved during this period.

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Twitter Plugin Challenges:** The Twitter integration is facing multiple significant issues. In [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), users continue to report client initialization errors, with a suggested fix in a previous version reportedly introducing a new memory insertion error. Separately, in [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38), users are hitting API rate limits ("Too Many Requests") when fetching timelines, even with recent updates intended to fix the problem. The conversation is now exploring the necessity of a paid Twitter API subscription as a potential solution.
    -   **Custom Plugin Callback Interference:** Discussion is ongoing in [#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947) regarding a bug where the `ATTACHMENTS` provider overrides a custom plugin's action callback. A potential fix has been implemented, and the community is now working to confirm its effectiveness and investigate other potential conflicts.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was highly visible this week through active troubleshooting in the issues section. Multiple users (`joaoCarvalho1000`, `RolandOne`, `Ovodo`, `nccuong-vikki`) collaborated on diagnosing the complex Twitter plugin problems in issues [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31) and [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38), sharing experiences and investigating potential causes from API limitations to version-specific bugs. Similarly, issue [#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947) saw collaborative debugging between `Claude` and `tcm390` to resolve the callback interference bug.
