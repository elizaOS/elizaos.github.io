# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on expanding the plugin ecosystem, with the official addition of the Mattermost and Bonsai plugins to the registry. This progress, however, was matched by significant community discussion around persistent issues with the Twitter plugin, where problems related to client initialization, memory errors, and API rate limits are hindering the development of autonomous agents. Another key technical challenge under investigation is a bug causing custom plugin action callbacks to be improperly overridden.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary focus of completed work was the expansion of the plugin registry, broadening the integration capabilities of the ElizaOS framework.

*   **New Plugin Integrations:** Two new plugins were published and added to the registry. The `plugin-mattermost` ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)) was added to enhance client integration options, and `plugin-bonsai` ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191)) was also made available for use.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week. Discussions were concentrated on several critical active issues, particularly concerning the Twitter plugin and core plugin functionality.

*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved this period.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Twitter Plugin Instability:** The Twitter plugin is the subject of multiple high-activity issue threads.
        *   In [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), users continue to report client initialization errors, with one user confirming the issue this week. The discussion suggests that while a newer plugin version might fix the initial error, it may introduce a new memory insertion problem, leading the community to question the current viability of autonomous Twitter agents.
        *   In [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38), users are hitting API rate limits when fetching the home timeline. While it was clarified that the free Twitter API tier is insufficient, a user on a newer plugin version (1.2.16) confirmed they still receive "Too Many Requests" errors, indicating the issue may not be solely related to the API subscription tier.
    *   **Custom Plugin Callback Interference:** Discussion continued in [#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947) regarding a bug where a custom plugin's action is overridden by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider. A potential fix was implemented, and follow-up investigation is underway to confirm the resolution and check for other potential conflicts within `plugin-bootstrap`.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was most visible in the collaborative troubleshooting of the Twitter plugin issues. Multiple users, including `joaoCarvalho1000`, `web-mickey`, and `ksaitor`, provided confirmations and details on issues [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31) and [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38). This user feedback was met with suggestions and clarifications from other community members like `ChristopherTrimboli` and `RolandOne`, demonstrating a collective effort to diagnose these significant blockers. On the development side, the back-and-forth on issue [#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947) shows active developer collaboration on a core technical bug.
