# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on expanding the plugin ecosystem while simultaneously addressing critical integration challenges. The registry grew with the addition of the Mattermost and Bonsai plugins, broadening the platform's capabilities. However, significant community discussion centered on persistent issues with the Twitter plugin, including initialization errors and API rate limits, which remain key blockers for users. Additionally, an important architectural discussion is underway to resolve custom plugin callback interference.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development work this week involved expanding the official plugin registry, making new tools available to ElizaOS users.

*   **Plugin Registry Expansion:**
    *   The `plugin-mattermost` was added to the registry, enabling integration with the Mattermost collaboration platform ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)).
    *   The `plugin-bonsai` was also published and added to the registry's index, making it available for use ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week. The focus remained on diagnosing and discussing several complex, active issues.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Twitter Plugin Instability:** The Twitter plugin continues to be a major point of discussion across multiple issues.
        *   In [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), users are still reporting client initialization errors, with a new user confirming the problem this week. The discussion suggests that while a previous update (v1.0.14) may have addressed the initial error, it might have introduced a new memory insertion issue.
        *   In [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38), users are hitting API rate limits when fetching the home timeline. The conversation clarified that the free Twitter API tier is insufficient, but a user on a newer plugin version (1.2.16) still reported "Too Many Requests" errors, indicating the issue may not be fully resolved.
    *   **Custom Plugin Callback Interference ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947)):** An ongoing discussion addresses a bug where a provider is overwriting a custom plugin's action callback. A potential fix was proposed, and follow-up investigation is underway to check for conflicting actions in `plugin-bootstrap` that might be the root cause.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was strong this week, primarily centered on collaborative troubleshooting within GitHub Issues. Multiple users, including `joaoCarvalho1000`, `web-mickey`, and `ksaitor`, provided feedback and confirmed they were experiencing the reported Twitter plugin issues ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38)). This user feedback was met with diagnostic help from contributors like `ChristopherTrimboli` and `tcm390`, showcasing an active and engaged community working together to solve complex integration problems.
