# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's focus was on expanding the plugin ecosystem, with the successful addition of the Mattermost and Bonsai plugins to the registry. This growth, however, was contrasted by persistent challenges in core functionality and third-party integrations. Significant community discussion centered on troubleshooting the Twitter plugin, where issues with client initialization and API rate limits are questioning the feasibility of autonomous agents on the platform without paid subscriptions. Concurrently, an important architectural issue regarding custom plugin callback interference saw active debate, highlighting an ongoing effort to stabilize the foundation for developers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development effort this week was centered on growing the number of available plugins.

*   **Plugin Ecosystem Expansion:** Two new plugins were officially added to the registry, broadening the capabilities of the ElizaOS framework.
    *   The `plugin-mattermost` was integrated, expanding the range of supported client integrations ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)).
    *   The `plugin-bonsai` was also published, with updates made to the registry's `index.json` to reflect its availability ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week. The focus remained on diagnosing and discussing several critical active issues.

*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved this week.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Twitter Plugin Instability:** A major theme this week was the ongoing trouble with the Twitter plugin, discussed across two key issues. In [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), users continue to report client initialization errors, even with version `1.0.14` which was intended as a fix. Relatedly, issue [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38) highlights persistent "Too Many Requests" (429) errors when fetching timelines, even with recent updates. The conversation in the community is now shifting towards the conclusion that a paid Twitter API subscription may be required for stable operation, posing a potential blocker for users.
    *   **Core Callback Interference:** Discussion continued on [#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947), a critical issue where a custom plugin's action callback is being overridden by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider. A potential fix was proposed, and follow-up discussion is underway to confirm if the solution is effective, indicating an active effort to resolve this foundational problem for plugin developers.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was strong this week, primarily centered on collaborative troubleshooting within GitHub Issues. The discussions around the Twitter plugin issues ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31), [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38)) saw multiple users (`joaoCarvalho1000`, `RolandOne`, `Ovodo`, `nccuong-vikki`) sharing their experiences, confirming the bug's persistence, and collectively investigating the root cause related to API limitations. Similarly, the callback interference issue ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947)) demonstrated a healthy feedback loop between contributors as they work towards a solution.
