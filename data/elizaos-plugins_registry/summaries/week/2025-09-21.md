# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Sep 21 - 27, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on the growth and maintenance of the plugin registry. Development focused on expanding the ecosystem with submissions for two new plugins, `@leopham/plugin-u2u` and `plugin-beacon`. Alongside this expansion, a key bug fix was implemented to correct the package namespace for the token metrics plugin, ensuring the registry remains accurate and reliable. Overall, it was a week of steady progress in both expanding functionality and maintaining the integrity of the existing registry.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
