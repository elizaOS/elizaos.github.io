# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Feb 8 - 14, 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week, the ElizaOS registry saw a concentrated expansion of its modular ecosystem, specifically focusing on financial infrastructure and real-world data integration. The primary theme was the strengthening of agent autonomy through secure transaction guardrails, decentralized finance (DeFi) trading capabilities, and specialized payment gateways. By integrating tools for escrow, perpetual trading, and live sports data, the registry has significantly broadened the functional scope for developers building sophisticated AI agents across both Web2 and Web3 environments.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### Financial Infrastructure & Payment Gateways
A major focus this week was providing agents with robust tools for handling value exchange and financial security.
*   **Transaction Guardrails:** Integration of `@proofgate/eliza-plugin` provides essential validation guardrails for agent transactions ([#254](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/254), [#257](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/257)).
*   **Escrow & Micropayments:** New plugins include `@kamiyo/eliza` for Solana-based escrow and dispute resolution ([#246](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/246)) and `plugin-coinrailz` for crypto micropayment services ([#245](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/245)).
*   **Fiat On/Off-Ramps:** The addition of AsterPay enables x402 payments with a specific focus on EUR off-ramping ([#251](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/251)).

### Trading & Marketplace Capabilities
The registry expanded its support for decentralized commerce and advanced trading mechanics.
*   **Perpetual Trading:** The Arthur DEX plugin was added to support perpetual trading on the Orderly Network ([#256](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/256)).
*   **Agent Economy:** The `plugin-moltbazaar` was integrated to facilitate an AI Agent Job Marketplace on Base, allowing agents to participate in a decentralized labor economy ([#255](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/255)).

### Data Integration & Model Routing
New plugins were added to enhance the "intelligence" and information access of ElizaOS agents.
*   **Real-time Data:** Integration of `@elizaos/plugin-sportradar` allows agents to consume live sports data ([#250](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/250)).
*   **Model Access:** The `@zane-archer/plugin-aimo-router` was added to streamline access to models from the AiMo Network ([#247](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/247)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The reporting period showed a stable maintenance phase with a focus on merging contributions rather than resolving bugs or addressing new issues.
*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported closed during this timeframe.
*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there were no active issues with significant discussion (3+ comments) reported. This suggests a smooth integration process for the new plugins added this week.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The activity this week reflects a healthy influx of external contributions, as evidenced by the variety of third-party namespaces (e.g., `@proofgate`, `@kamiyo`, `@zane-archer`) entering the registry. The collaboration is characterized by a high volume of Pull Requests aimed at expanding the ecosystem's modularity. The successful integration of diverse tools—ranging from sports data to perpetual trading—indicates that the ElizaOS contributor base is actively working toward the project's goal of a decentralized and adaptable AI agent framework.
