# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jul 6 - 12, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on two parallel tracks: expanding the plugin ecosystem and tackling critical, persistent bugs. The registry grew with the addition of several new plugins, including one for Desearch. Concurrently, significant community effort was directed towards diagnosing complex issues, particularly plugin loading failures on Windows and a series of initialization errors with the Twitter plugin. While progress was made in identifying and reproducing these bugs, they remain active challenges for the community.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary development work this week centered on expanding the available plugins within the ElizaOS registry.

*   **Plugin Registry Expansion:** The registry was enhanced with new integrations to broaden the framework's capabilities. This included the addition of `plugin-desearch` (v0.1.2) to enable decentralized search ([#187](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/187)) and the incorporation of several missing plugins from the BD list ([#189](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/189)). A pull request was also opened to add the `@manuelbarbas/plugin-fair` ([#190](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/190)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week. The focus was on investigating and gathering data for several high-priority active issues.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Platform-Specific Plugin Loading Failures:** A significant trend this week involves plugins failing to load, especially on Windows. In issue [#5407](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5407), contributors confirmed that `@elizaos/plugin-openai` and `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` still fail on Windows, with multiple users providing detailed reproduction steps. A related issue, [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5499), concerning `plugin-local-ai`, was also reported to affect Mac users, with the community suggesting a fixed version (`v1.2.1`) as a potential solution.
    *   **Twitter Plugin Initialization Errors:** The Twitter plugin continues to be a source of problems. A new issue ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/36)) was opened for client creation failures after migrating agents to V2. Meanwhile, discussion on an existing issue ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31)) revealed that the latest update (v1.0.14), intended to be a fix, has introduced a new memory-related error, which was confirmed by multiple users.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong community collaboration in troubleshooting complex bugs. Multiple users, including @gcbsumid, @SYMBaiEX, @RolandOne, @yasir23, and @joaoCarvalho1000, actively participated in issue threads. Their contributions of detailed reports, screenshots, and confirmations were crucial in diagnosing the persistent Windows loading failures and the evolving errors in the Twitter plugin. This collective debugging effort is central to moving these critical issues toward a resolution.
