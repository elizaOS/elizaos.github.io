# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on expanding the plugin ecosystem and addressing critical user feedback. A new plugin for self-sovereign identity was successfully integrated, broadening the framework's capabilities. However, a significant new bug was identified in the CLI, causing module resolution errors upon installation. Concurrently, an important community discussion highlighted severe user frustrations with plugin documentation, pointing to challenges in the developer onboarding experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary technical advancement was the expansion of available plugins.

*   **New Self-Sovereign Identity Plugin**
    *   The "nuggets" plugin was added to the registry, enabling agents to interact with the Nuggets platform for self-sovereign identity and end-user data verification ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/236)). The integration included ensuring the plugin's entry in `index.json` conformed to project naming conventions.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on a newly discovered CLI bug and an ongoing discussion regarding documentation quality.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   Based on the available reports, no issues were closed this week.

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **CLI Installation Bug:** A critical new issue ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6088)) was opened concerning a `Cannot find module` error when running `elizaos --version`. The problem is suspected to be a bundling issue in the published npm package, and the current workaround requires using a local repository clone.
    *   **Plugin Documentation Quality:** Discussion continued on an active issue regarding inaccurate plugin documentation ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6070)). A user reported significant frustration and an inability to scaffold plugins after a week of effort, ultimately leading them to switch to a different framework.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community interaction was most visible in the discussion around documentation challenges ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6070)). A core contributor actively engaged with a user who expressed deep frustration with the framework's usability, offering direct assistance and acknowledging that documentation can lag behind development. This exchange highlights both the project's commitment to engaging with user feedback and a critical pain point in the new user experience that may be acting as a barrier to adoption.
