# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by significant growth in the plugin ecosystem and a strong focus on enhancing core stability. The registry expanded with the addition of four new plugins, while the team successfully resolved several long-standing bugs related to plugin callbacks, knowledge management (RAG), and API behavior, many of which were confirmed fixed in version 1.0.9. Alongside this stabilization effort, a new feature request for customizable logging sparked immediate and detailed implementation planning, signaling a continued focus on developer experience and extensibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on expanding the registry's offerings and performing essential maintenance.

*   **Plugin Registry Expansion:** The ecosystem grew with the addition of four new plugins, broadening the capabilities available to ElizaOS agents.
    *   `@yungalgo/plugin-coconut` was proposed for addition ([#175](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/175)).
    *   `@yungalgo/plugin-jellie` and `@yungalgo/plugin-jello` were added ([#177](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/177), [#176](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/176)).
    *   The "kudo" plugin was added to the registry ([#179](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/179)).

*   **Registry Maintenance:** Efforts were made to ensure the registry remains accurate and up-to-date.
    *   Plugin repository locations were updated in `index.json` to reflect a migration from the `notorious-d-e-v` to the `payai` GitHub organization ([#172](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/172)).
    *   A pull request was opened to update the `plugin-cardano` repository ([#178](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/178)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
This week saw the closure of numerous critical issues, improving system reliability, while new discussions point toward future enhancements.

*   **Closed Issues:** A significant number of bugs and feature requests were resolved, enhancing stability and functionality.
    *   **Plugin Callbacks:** A critical bug preventing callbacks from plugin actions from reaching the end-user chat response was fixed and closed, resolving issues with `plugin-evm` and `plugin-mcp` ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5017)).
    *   **Knowledge Management (RAG):** An issue where RAG functionality was not working correctly was closed after a user confirmed the fix in version 1.0.9 ([#5004](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5004)).
    *   **API & Agent Behavior:** Problems with successive agent replies ([#4940](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4940)) and room creation via the REST API ([#4955](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4955)) were confirmed as fixed.
    *   **CLI:** An issue where the `elizaos update` command failed was resolved with clarification on the correct update procedure ([#5198](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5198)).
    *   **LLM Integration:** A request for Bedrock LLM integration was closed following the release of a dedicated plugin ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5117)).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Custom Logger Configuration:** A new feature request was opened to allow downstream projects to customize the root logger, enabling more flexible logging configurations ([#5183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5183)). This issue has already seen significant activity, including a detailed implementation plan.
    *   **Active Discussions:** Progress was made on older issues, with a maintainer noting that the web client version discrepancy ([#4924](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4924)) may no longer be reproducible. Guidance was also provided on how to check for currently loaded plugins ([#4931](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4931)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was strong this week, highlighted by effective user-maintainer feedback loops and proactive feature development. The resolution of the plugin callback issue ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5017)) involved multiple community members providing feedback, workarounds, and final confirmation. The new logger feature request ([#5183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5183)) demonstrated rapid and constructive collaboration, with one contributor providing a comprehensive implementation plan shortly after the issue was raised. The addition of multiple plugins from the `@yungalgo` scope also suggests active engagement from external teams integrating with the ElizaOS framework.
