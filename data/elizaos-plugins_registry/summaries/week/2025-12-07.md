# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's development was characterized by a focused expansion of the ElizaOS ecosystem. The primary activity involved growing the plugin registry to enhance agent capabilities in key areas. Two significant community-contributed plugins were integrated, adding functionalities for both Web3 decentralized finance (DeFi) and communication. While the rest of the week saw no major code changes or issue triage, these additions represent a meaningful step forward in our mission to build a modular and versatile AI agent framework.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The week's efforts were concentrated on integrating new plugins into the registry, directly supporting the project's goal of modular extensibility.

-   **New Plugin Integrations:**
    -   A Moralis DeFi plugin (`@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2`) was added to provide agents with Moralis DeFi functionalities, deepening our Web3 capabilities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).
    -   An OpenChat integration plugin (`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) was also merged, enabling agents to leverage OpenChat for communication tasks ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).
