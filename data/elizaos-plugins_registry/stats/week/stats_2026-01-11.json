      "author": "1bcMax",
      "number": 248,
      "body": "## Summary\n\nAdd BlockRun plugin to the ElizaOS registry.\n\n**Package:** `@blockrun/elizaos-plugin`\n**Repository:** https://github.com/BlockRunAI/elizaos-plugin-blockrun\n**npm:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blockrun/elizaos-plugin\n\n## Description\n\nThis plugin enables ElizaOS agents to make pay-per-request AI calls using the [x402 protocol](https://x402.org), paying with USDC micropayments on Base chain. No API keys required - just a wallet with USDC.\n\n**Features:**\n- `BLOCKRUN_CHAT` action: Pay-per-request access to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more\n- `BLOCKRUN_WALLET` provider: Wallet address and USDC balance on Base\n- Automatic x402 payment handling via EIP-712 signatures\n\n**Supported Models:**\n- OpenAI: gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini\n- Anthropic: claude-sonnet-4, claude-3.5-haiku\n- Google: gemini-2.0-flash\n\nTypical cost: $0.001-0.01 per request\n\n## Links\n\n- [BlockRun](https://blockrun.ai) - Pay-per-request AI gateway\n- [x402 Protocol](https://x402.org) - HTTP 402 micropayment standard\n\n<!-- greptile_comment -->\n\n<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>\n\n### Greptile Summary\n\nThis PR adds the BlockRun plugin (`@blockrun/elizaos-plugin`) to the ElizaOS plugin registry. The plugin enables ElizaOS agents to make pay-per-request AI calls using the x402 micropayment protocol with USDC on the Base chain.\n\n**What Changed:**\n- Added a single entry to `index.json`: `\"@blockrun/elizaos-plugin\":\"github:BlockRunAI/elizaos-plugin-blockrun\"`\n- The entry is correctly positioned alphabetically between `@bealers/plugin-mattermost` and `@elizaos/adapter-mongodb`\n\n**Registry Format Compliance:**\n✅ **Only index.json modified** - No other files were changed, adhering to the strict contribution guidelines\n✅ **Correct format** - Entry follows the required `\"@npm-package-name\": \"github:org/repo\"` pattern\n✅ **Alphabetical ordering** - Entry is properly sorted within the registry\n✅ **Valid JSON syntax** - No syntax errors introduced\n✅ **No duplicates** - No conflicting entries exist\n✅ **Consistent formatting** - Uses the same 3-space indentation as other entries\n\n**Plugin Details (from PR description):**\nThe BlockRun plugin provides:\n- `BLOCKRUN_CHAT` action for pay-per-request AI model access (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)\n- `BLOCKRUN_WALLET` provider for wallet address and USDC balance on Base chain\n- Automatic x402 payment handling via EIP-712 signatures\n- No API keys required - just a wallet with USDC\n\n**Integration:**\nOnce merged, the GitHub Action will automatically process this entry to:\n1. Fetch repository metadata from GitHub\n2. Detect version compatibility (v0.x vs v1.x)\n3. Update `generated-registry.json` with full plugin details\n4. Make the plugin available for installation via the ElizaOS CLI\n\n### Confidence Score: 5/5\n\n- This PR is safe to merge with no identified issues\n- The PR perfectly follows all registry contribution guidelines: only index.json is modified, the entry uses correct format and alphabetical ordering, JSON syntax is valid, and no duplicates exist. The change is minimal and isolated to a single line addition. While I cannot verify the external GitHub repository and NPM package exist without network access, the automated GitHub workflow will validate these before final merge. The plugin entry follows the same pattern as other third-party plugins already in the registry.\n- No files require special attention\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\nFile Analysis\n\n\n\n| Filename | Score | Overview |\n|----------|-------|----------|\n| index.json | 5/5 | Added @blockrun/elizaos-plugin entry with correct format, alphabetical ordering, and no syntax errors |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Contributor\n    participant Registry as elizaos-plugins/registry\n    participant GHAction as GitHub Action\n    participant GenScript as generate-registry.js\n    participant NPM as npm registry\n    participant GitRepo as GitHub Repository\n    participant ElizaOS as ElizaOS Agent\n    \n    Contributor->>Registry: Submit PR with new entry in index.json\n    Note over Registry: Entry: \"@blockrun/elizaos-plugin\": \"github:BlockRunAI/elizaos-plugin-blockrun\"\n    \n    Registry->>GHAction: Trigger claude-code-review workflow\n    GHAction->>GitRepo: Validate GitHub repository exists\n    GHAction->>NPM: Validate NPM package exists\n    GHAction->>Registry: Review PR (format, sorting, duplicates)\n    \n    alt PR Approved and Merged\n        Registry->>GHAction: Trigger generate-registry-json workflow\n        GHAction->>GenScript: Execute generation script\n        GenScript->>GitRepo: Fetch branches, tags, package.json\n        GenScript->>NPM: Fetch package metadata\n        GenScript->>GenScript: Detect v0.x and v1.x compatibility\n        GenScript->>Registry: Commit generated-registry.json\n        \n        ElizaOS->>Registry: Fetch generated-registry.json\n        ElizaOS->>ElizaOS: Load plugin from registry\n        ElizaOS->>GitRepo: Install plugin via npm\n        ElizaOS->>ElizaOS: Initialize plugin with actions/providers\n    else PR Rejected\n        GHAction->>Contributor: Request changes\n    end\n```\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<sub>(3/5) Reply to the agent's comments like \"Can you suggest a fix for this @greptileai?\" or ask follow-up questions!</sub>\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
