The JSON syntax is valid and the comma handling is correct. The alphabetical ordering issue needs to be fixed before merge.\n- index.json requires the new entry to be moved to correct alphabetical position (around line 150)\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| index.json | Added `@proofgate/eliza-plugin` entry but placed in incorrect alphabetical position |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Dev as Developer\n    participant PR as Pull Request\n    participant GH as GitHub Actions\n    participant Script as generate-registry.js\n    participant NPM as NPM Registry\n    participant Repo as Plugin Repository\n    \n    Dev->>PR: Add @proofgate/eliza-plugin to index.json\n    PR->>GH: Trigger on merge to main\n    GH->>Script: Run npm run generate-registry\n    Script->>Repo: Fetch package.json via GitHub API\n    Script->>NPM: Fetch package metadata\n    Script->>Script: Validate @elizaos/core compatibility\n    Script->>Script: Check v0/v1 version support\n    Script->>Script: Extract repo description, topics\n    Script->>GH: Generate generated-registry.json\n    GH->>PR: Auto-commit generated file\n```\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<sub>(2/5) Greptile learns from your feedback when you react with thumbs up/down!</sub>\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
