      "title": "feat: detect version/core dependency mismatches and fix supports flags",
      "author": "wtfsayo",
      "number": 244,
      "body": "## Summary\n\nImproves the registry generation script to:\n1. **Detect and warn** about package version vs core dependency mismatches\n2. **Correctly set `supports` flags** based on actual core dependency (not package version)\n\n## The Problem\n\nSome plugins have mismatched versioning:\n- **v0 packages depending on v1 core** (e.g., `@nuggetslife/plugin-nuggets@0.1.0` → `@elizaos/core: 1.5.5`)\n- **v1 packages depending on v0 core** (e.g., `@elizaos/plugin-ankr@1.0.0` → `@elizaos/core: ^0.25.9`)\n\nPreviously, these plugins were incorrectly marked in the `supports` field, making them undiscoverable.\n\n## The Solution\n\n### 1. Core dependency determines compatibility\n\nThe core dependency is what actually matters for compatibility:\n\n| Scenario | supports.v0 | supports.v1 | Warning |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|\n| v0 pkg + v0 core | ✓ | - | - |\n| v0 pkg + v1 core | - | ✓ | \"should publish as v1.x\" |\n| v1 pkg + v1 core | - | ✓ | - |\n| v1 pkg + v0 core | ✓ | - | \"needs to update core\" |\n\n### 2. Conservative regex for mismatch detection\n\nOnly matches **definitive** constraints (`^0.x`, `~0.x`, `0.x`), excludes ambiguous operators (`>=`, `<`) that could span multiple majors.\n\n## Example Output\n\n```\nProcessing @nuggetslife/plugin-nuggets...\n@nuggetslife/plugin-nuggets → v0:false v1:true\n\n⚠️  Issues encountered for 8 repositories:\n  @elizaos/plugin-ankr:\n    - ⚠️ v1 package (1.0.0) depends on v0 core (^0.25.9) - needs to update @elizaos/core to ^1.0.0\n  @nuggetslife/plugin-nuggets:\n    - ⚠️ v0 package (0.1.0) depends on v1 core (1.5.5) - should publish as v1.x\n```\n\n## Affected Packages\n\n| Package | Issue | Now Marked As |\n|---------|-------|---------------|\n| `@elizaos/plugin-ankr` | v1 pkg with v0 core | `supports.v0: true` |\n| `@elizaos/plugin-near` | v1 pkg with v0 core | `supports.v0: true` |\n| `@elizaos/plugin-local-ai` | v0 pkg with v1 core | `supports.v1: true` |\n| `@nuggetslife/plugin-nuggets` | v0 pkg with v1 core | `supports.v1: true` |\n| `@kudo-dev/plugin-kudo` | v0 pkg with v1 core | `supports.v1: true` |\n| `@theschein/plugin-polymarket` | v0 pkg with v1 core | `supports.v1: true` |\n| `plugin-octav` | v0 pkg with v1 core | `supports.v1: true` |\n| `@esscrypt/plugin-polkadot` | v0 pkg with v1 core | `supports.v1: true` |\n\n## Changes\n\n- Add `getCoreRangeMajor()` helper with conservative regex\n- Set `supports.v1 = true` for v0 packages that depend on v1 core\n- Set `supports.v0 = true` for v1 packages that depend on v0 core  \n- Add warnings to issues summary for versioning problems",
