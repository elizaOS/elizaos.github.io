      "number": 199,
      "body": "## Summary\n\nThis PR fixes critical issues in the registry generation script related to v1 compatibility detection and semver handling.\n\n## Issues Fixed\n\n### 1. **Incorrect v1 compatibility detection**\n- **Problem**: Packages were marked as v1-compatible based solely on having a v1.x version published, regardless of their `@elizaos/core` dependency\n- **Example**: `@elizaos/plugin-hedera` was incorrectly marked as v1-compatible despite not having proper core dependency\n- **Solution**: Enhanced NPM package inspection to fetch and validate actual `@elizaos/core` dependency ranges\n\n### 2. **Script crashes with dependency strings**\n- **Problem**: Raw dependency strings like `\"latest\"`, `\"0.25.6-alpha.1\"` caused `semver.satisfies()` to crash\n- **Solution**: Added `normalizeDependencyRange()` and `safelyCheckSemverSatisfies()` helpers\n\n## Key Changes\n\nâœ… **Enhanced NPM package inspection**: Now extracts `@elizaos/core` dependency ranges from package.json  \nâœ… **Fixed NPM fallback logic**: Validates both version AND core dependency constraints  \nâœ… **Added semver normalization**: Handles `\"latest\"` â†’ `\">=0.0.0\"`, exact versions â†’ ranges  \nâœ… **Added error handling**: Prevents crashes with invalid dependency strings  \nâœ… **Regenerated registry**: With corrected v1 compatibility flags  \n\n## Verification\n\n- âœ… **No crashes**: Script completes successfully with all dependency string types\n- âœ… **Correct v1 detection**: `@elizaos/plugin-hedera` now properly marked as `v1: false`\n- âœ… **\"latest\" handling**: Packages with `\"latest\"` dependencies correctly evaluated\n- âœ… **Exact version handling**: Dependencies like `\"0.25.6-alpha.1\"` converted to ranges and evaluated properly\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Eliminates false positives**: Packages without proper `@elizaos/core >= 1.0.0` dependency no longer incorrectly marked as v1-compatible\n- **Prevents crashes**: Robust handling of all dependency string formats\n- **Improves accuracy**: v1 compatibility now strictly based on actual core dependency satisfaction\n\nThis ensures the registry accurately reflects which plugins are truly compatible with v1 of the elizaOS core.",
