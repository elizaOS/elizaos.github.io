      "title": "Fix: Resolve React rendering error for author objects in plugin registry",
      "author": "wtfsayo",
      "number": 211,
      "body": "## Problem\n\nThe local development server was crashing with a React rendering error:\n```\nObjects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {name, email})\n```\n\nThis occurred because some package.json files in plugin repositories have the `author` field as an object with `name` and `email` properties, rather than a simple string. React cannot render objects directly as children, causing the application to crash.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nIn the plugin registry app, when fetching package.json files from GitHub repositories, the code was directly using `content.author` without checking if it was an object or string. When package.json contained:\n```json\n{\n  \"author\": {\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"email\": \"john@example.com\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nInstead of:\n```json\n{\n  \"author\": \"John Doe\"\n}\n```\n\nReact would try to render the object directly, causing the error.\n\n## Solution\n\n### 1. Author Field Handling\n- Added proper type checking for the `author` field\n- Extract `name` or `email` from author objects gracefully\n- Fallback to 'unknown' if neither is available\n\n### 2. Enhanced Error Handling\n- Improved network error handling for package.json fetches\n- Better error boundaries for missing or malformed data\n- More robust fallback mechanisms\n\n### 3. TypeScript Improvements\n- Fixed type safety for error state (`string | null` instead of `null`)\n- Added proper fallback values for missing fields\n\n### 4. Code Structure Improvements\n- Refactored nested try-catch blocks for better readability\n- Consolidated content handling logic\n- Added comprehensive error logging\n\n## Changes Made\n\n```typescript\n// Before\nauthor: content.author,\n\n// After\nauthor: typeof content.author === 'object' \n  ? content.author?.name || content.author?.email || 'unknown'\n  : content.author || 'unknown',\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n- ‚úÖ Local development server runs without React rendering errors\n- ‚úÖ Plugin registry loads successfully with mixed author field types\n- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of 404s for missing package.json files\n- ‚úÖ Proper fallbacks for missing or malformed data\n- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation without errors\n\n## Impact\n\n- Fixes critical React rendering crash in local development\n- Improves robustness of plugin data fetching\n- Better user experience with graceful error handling\n- Maintains backward compatibility with existing string-based authors\n\nThis fix ensures the plugin registry can handle the variety of package.json formats found in the ElizaOS plugin ecosystem without crashing.\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n- New Features\n  - More resilient plugin loading with validation and graceful fallbacks, ensuring the plugin list populates even under network issues.\n  - Displays partial plugin info with sensible defaults (version, description, author) when data is missing.\n  - Improved author handling from various formats for clearer attribution.\n\n- Bug Fixes\n  - Prevents crashes/blank states caused by malformed or missing plugin data.\n  - Ignores invalid registry entries to reduce broken or noisy listings.\n  - Provides clearer error states when plugin details can‚Äôt be fully retrieved.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",

      "author": "wtfsayo",
      "number": 199,
      "body": "## Summary\n\nThis PR fixes critical issues in the registry generation script related to v1 compatibility detection and semver handling.\n\n## Issues Fixed\n\n### 1. **Incorrect v1 compatibility detection**\n- **Problem**: Packages were marked as v1-compatible based solely on having a v1.x version published, regardless of their `@elizaos/core` dependency\n- **Example**: `@elizaos/plugin-hedera` was incorrectly marked as v1-compatible despite not having proper core dependency\n- **Solution**: Enhanced NPM package inspection to fetch and validate actual `@elizaos/core` dependency ranges\n\n### 2. **Script crashes with dependency strings**\n- **Problem**: Raw dependency strings like `\"latest\"`, `\"0.25.6-alpha.1\"` caused `semver.satisfies()` to crash\n- **Solution**: Added `normalizeDependencyRange()` and `safelyCheckSemverSatisfies()` helpers\n\n## Key Changes\n\n‚úÖ **Enhanced NPM package inspection**: Now extracts `@elizaos/core` dependency ranges from package.json  \n‚úÖ **Fixed NPM fallback logic**: Validates both version AND core dependency constraints  \n‚úÖ **Added semver normalization**: Handles `\"latest\"` ‚Üí `\">=0.0.0\"`, exact versions ‚Üí ranges  \n‚úÖ **Added error handling**: Prevents crashes with invalid dependency strings  \n‚úÖ **Regenerated registry**: With corrected v1 compatibility flags  \n\n## Verification\n\n- ‚úÖ **No crashes**: Script completes successfully with all dependency string types\n- ‚úÖ **Correct v1 detection**: `@elizaos/plugin-hedera` now properly marked as `v1: false`\n- ‚úÖ **\"latest\" handling**: Packages with `\"latest\"` dependencies correctly evaluated\n- ‚úÖ **Exact version handling**: Dependencies like `\"0.25.6-alpha.1\"` converted to ranges and evaluated properly\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Eliminates false positives**: Packages without proper `@elizaos/core >= 1.0.0` dependency no longer incorrectly marked as v1-compatible\n- **Prevents crashes**: Robust handling of all dependency string formats\n- **Improves accuracy**: v1 compatibility now strictly based on actual core dependency satisfaction\n\nThis ensures the registry accurately reflects which plugins are truly compatible with v1 of the elizaOS core.",
