      "body": "## Summary\n\nSwitch compatibility detection to use semantic version range intersection instead of point satisfaction.\n\n- v0 compatibility: intersects with band `>=0.0.0 <1.0.0`\n- v1 compatibility: intersects with band `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0`\n- Eliminates false negatives for plugins requiring higher v1 core (e.g., `^1.0.15`)\n- Keeps logic simple and aligned with intended semantics\n\n## Why\n\nPrevious logic checked if specific versions (e.g., `1.0.0`) satisfied plugin ranges (e.g., `^1.0.15`), which is backwards and caused misclassification.\n\n## Implementation\n\n- `normalizeDependencyRange` now returns `semver.validRange(...)` (or null)\n- `isCompatibleWithMajorVersion(range, major)` now uses `semver.intersects(range, band)`\n\n## Result\n\n- `@elizaos/plugin-hedera` now correctly reports: `v0:false v1:true`\n- Registry generation runs clean without workspace:* noise.\n\n## References\n- https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/214\n\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **Bug Fixes**\n  * Corrected a minor JSON formatting issue to prevent parsing errors.\n\n* **Refactor**\n  * Improved version compatibility checks to use normalized ranges and major-version bands for more reliable results.\n  * Enhanced error messages to clearly reference the relevant major version and range.\n  * Treats unknown major versions as incompatible to avoid false positives.\n\n* **Chores**\n  * Updated internal tooling and references to align with the new compatibility logic.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
