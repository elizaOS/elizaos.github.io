      "author": "kaiclawd",
      "number": 264,
      "body": "Adds `@elizaos/plugin-said` to the ElizaOS plugin registry.\n\n**Repo:** https://github.com/kaiclawd/plugin-said\n\nEvery ElizaOS agent using this plugin gets a free on-chain Solana identity via SAID Protocol on first run. Zero new dependencies, fully opt-in, non-blocking.\n\n```json\n{ \"plugins\": [\"@elizaos/plugin-said\"] }\n```\n\n→ Agent gets Solana keypair + SAID identity at [saidprotocol.com/agents](https://saidprotocol.com/agents)\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **Style**\n  * Adjusted code formatting in configuration file.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n<!-- greptile_comment -->\n\n<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>\n\nAdds `@elizaos/plugin-said` to the plugin registry, mapping it to `github:kaiclawd/plugin-said`. The new entry follows the `@elizaos/` namespace convention used by many third-party plugins and is correctly placed in alphabetical order between `plugin-safe` and `plugin-sei`.\n\n- The only functional change is the addition of one new registry entry on line 181\n- The diff appears large (244 lines changed) because the PR also reformats the entire file's indentation from 3 spaces to 2 spaces — this is cosmetic and does not affect any other entries\n- No existing entries were removed or modified (entry count went from 241 → 242)\n\n<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>\n\n- This PR is safe to merge — it only adds a single registry entry with no logic changes.\n- The functional change is minimal (one new JSON key-value pair) and follows existing patterns. The entry is correctly alphabetized. Score is 4 instead of 5 due to the unnecessary whitespace reformatting that makes the diff harder to review and could cause merge conflicts with other pending PRs.\n- No files require special attention beyond the noted indentation change in `index.json`.\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| index.json | Adds `@elizaos/plugin-said` entry pointing to `github:kaiclawd/plugin-said`. Entry is correctly placed in alphabetical order. Indentation was changed from 3 spaces to 2 spaces across the entire file, inflating the diff unnecessarily. |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Flowchart</h3>\n\n```mermaid\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral'}}%%\nflowchart TD\n    A[\"index.json\\n(Plugin Registry)\"] -->|\"push to main\"| B[\"generate-registry-json.yml\\n(GitHub Action)\"]\n    B --> C[\"scripts/generate-registry.js\"]\n    C -->|\"reads index.json\"| A\n    C -->|\"fetches metadata from\"| D[\"GitHub API\\n(kaiclawd/plugin-said)\"]\n    C -->|\"checks npm\"| E[\"npm Registry\\n(@elizaos/plugin-said)\"]\n    C -->|\"writes\"| F[\"generated-registry.json\"]\n\n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style D fill:#bbf,stroke:#333\n    style E fill:#bbf,stroke:#333\n```\n\n<sub>Last reviewed commit: cd5fffc</sub>\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<sub>(2/5) Greptile learns from your feedback when you react with thumbs up/down!</sub>\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",

The only issue is alphabetical sort order, which is a convention in this file but not enforced by tooling. The registry generation script sorts entries alphabetically during processing anyway, so the ordering issue won't cause functional problems.\n- `index.json` has a minor alphabetical ordering issue that should ideally be fixed before merge.\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| index.json | Adds `@buzzbd/plugin-solcex-bd` entry pointing to `github:buzzbysolcex/plugin-solcex-bd`. Format and indentation are correct (3-space indent), but the entry breaks alphabetical sort order — it should appear after `@blockrun/elizaos-plugin`, not before it. |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Flowchart</h3>\n\n```mermaid\n%%{init: {'theme': 'neutral'}}%%\nflowchart TD\n    A[\"index.json\\n(plugin registry)\"] -->|\"+ @buzzbd/plugin-solcex-bd\"| B[\"CI: generate-registry.js\"]\n    B -->|\"Fetches GitHub + npm metadata\"| C[\"generated-registry.json\"]\n    C --> D[\"Registry site\\n(plugin browser)\"]\n    A -->|\"github:buzzbysolcex/plugin-solcex-bd\"| E[\"GitHub Repository\\nbuzzbysolcex/plugin-solcex-bd\"]\n    E -->|\"npm publish\"| F[\"npm\\n@buzzbd/plugin-solcex-bd\"]\n```\n\n<sub>Last reviewed commit: c177272</sub>\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<sub>(4/5) You can add custom instructions or style guidelines for the agent [here](https://app.greptile.com/review/github)!</sub>\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
