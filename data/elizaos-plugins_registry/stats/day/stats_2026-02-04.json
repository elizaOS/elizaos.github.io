If the plugin is related to AI or crypto, please add those as topics as well.\r\n- [x] add simple description in github repo\r\n- [x] follows this convention\r\n- [x] an images/banner.jpg and images/logo.jpg\r\n- [x] package.json has a agentConfig\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Plugin: @proofgate/eliza-plugin\r\n\r\n**Description:** Blockchain transaction validation guardrails for AI agents. Validates transactions against security policies before execution to prevent prompt injection attacks, infinite approvals, and unauthorized transactions.\r\n\r\n**NPM:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/@proofgate/eliza-plugin\r\n**Repo:** https://github.com/ProofGate/proofgate-eliza-plugin\r\n**Docs:** https://proofgate.xyz/docs\r\n\r\n## Telegram username\r\n[bytes0xCR6](https://t.me/bytes0xCR6)\r\n\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **Chores**\n  * Added a new plugin dependency mapping to the project configuration.\n  * Updated project dependencies and improved code formatting.\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n<!-- greptile_comment -->\n\n<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>\n\n<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>\n\nThis PR adds the `@proofgate/eliza-plugin` to the ElizaOS plugin registry, which provides blockchain transaction validation guardrails for AI agents to prevent security vulnerabilities like prompt injection attacks and unauthorized transactions.\n\n**Key Changes:**\n- Added `@proofgate/eliza-plugin` entry pointing to `github:ProofGate/proofgate-eliza-plugin`\n- Updated comma on previous last entry (`plugin-octav`)\n\n**Issues Found:**\n- The entry is placed at the end of the file (line 217) but should be alphabetically ordered around line 150, after `@elizaos/plugin-proof-of-agent` and before `@elizaos/plugin-pundiai-dataset`\n- The PR checklist claims alphabetical placement was verified, but this is incorrect\n\n**Required Action:**\nThe entry must be moved to the correct alphabetical position to maintain registry consistency and comply with the stated checklist requirements.\n\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\n\n- This PR has a significant ordering issue that violates the registry's alphabetical requirement\n- The change itself is simple and low-risk (adding a single registry entry with correct syntax), but the alphabetical placement is incorrect, which violates one of the core checklist requirements. The JSON syntax is valid and the comma handling is correct. The alphabetical ordering issue needs to be fixed before merge.\n- index.json requires the new entry to be moved to correct alphabetical position (around line 150)\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| index.json | Added `@proofgate/eliza-plugin` entry but placed in incorrect alphabetical position |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Dev as Developer\n    participant PR as Pull Request\n    participant GH as GitHub Actions\n    participant Script as generate-registry.js\n    participant NPM as NPM Registry\n    participant Repo as Plugin Repository\n    \n    Dev->>PR: Add @proofgate/eliza-plugin to index.json\n    PR->>GH: Trigger on merge to main\n    GH->>Script: Run npm run generate-registry\n    Script->>Repo: Fetch package.json via GitHub API\n    Script->>NPM: Fetch package metadata\n    Script->>Script: Validate @elizaos/core compatibility\n    Script->>Script: Check v0/v1 version support\n    Script->>Script: Extract repo description, topics\n    Script->>GH: Generate generated-registry.json\n    GH->>PR: Auto-commit generated file\n```\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<sub>(2/5) Greptile learns from your feedback when you react with thumbs up/down!</sub>\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
