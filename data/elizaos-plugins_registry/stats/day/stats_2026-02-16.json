      "number": 260,
      "body": "The current claude-review workflow fails on fork-based PRs with: \"Could not fetch an OIDC token\".\\n\\nThis switches the trigger to pull_request_target so OIDC + repo secrets are available, while checkout remains on the base ref (actions/checkout default behavior for pull_request_target), avoiding execution of untrusted PR code.\\n\\nAlso grants the action the write permissions it needs to post review feedback.\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **Chores**\n  * Expanded CI workflow triggers to include additional pull request events (including reopened).\n  * Elevated workflow permissions for pull requests and issues to enable more actions.\n  * Improved checkout behavior to use base commit references and avoid persisting credentials.\n  * Minor formatting cleanup in the workflow file.\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n<!-- greptile_comment -->\n\n<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>\n\nThis PR fixes the Claude Code Review workflow failing on fork-based PRs by switching the trigger from `pull_request` to `pull_request_target`, which grants access to OIDC tokens and repository secrets. It also upgrades `pull-requests` and `issues` permissions from `read` to `write` (needed for posting review comments), and adds the `reopened` event type.\n\n- **Security model is sound in principle**: The `actions/checkout@v4` step without an explicit `ref` defaults to the base branch under `pull_request_target`, avoiding checkout of untrusted fork code while secrets are available.\n- **Verify `claude-code-action` fetches PR diff via API**: The checkout is the base branch (main), so if the action relies on local file diffs rather than the GitHub API to read PR changes, the review would not see the actual PR content. This should be confirmed.\n- The `reopened` event type addition is a minor but useful improvement ensuring reviews re-trigger on reopened PRs.\n\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\n\n- This PR is likely safe to merge but has a functional concern that should be verified before merging.\n- The security model of using `pull_request_target` with a base-branch checkout is the correct pattern. However, it's unclear whether `claude-code-action` will still be able to review the actual PR changes when the checkout is the base branch (main) rather than the PR head. If the action relies on local git state to compute diffs, the review would be non-functional. The permissions and event type changes are straightforward and correct.\n- `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` — verify that `claude-code-action@beta` fetches PR diffs via GitHub API and does not depend on local checkout containing the PR code.\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| .github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml | Switches trigger from `pull_request` to `pull_request_target` for OIDC/secrets access on fork PRs, upgrades `pull-requests` and `issues` permissions to `write`, and adds `reopened` event type.
