# elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were centered on collaborative troubleshooting and foundational maintenance. The primary focus was a community-driven investigation into a critical import error affecting Eliza CLI version 1.61, with several contributors working together to diagnose the environment-specific issue. Alongside the debugging effort, a new pull request was introduced to automate dependency management using Renovate, signaling a move towards improving long-term project health and stability. Overall, the week was characterized by addressing core stability challenges rather than new feature development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no new features or bug fixes were merged, progress was made on improving project maintenance automation.

- **Dependency Management Automation:** A new pull request, [#2](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/pull/2), was opened to add a Renovate configuration. The goal of this change is to automate the process of keeping project dependencies up-to-date, reducing manual maintenance overhead.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week was dominated by the investigation of a single, high-impact bug.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. The main activity was concentrated on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031), "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61". The discussion progressed significantly, with `matteo-brandolino` suggesting the root cause may be missing type definition files in `@Elizaos/core` v1.6.1, as the problem is resolved by using either older or newer versions. To aid debugging, `matteo-brandolino` also provided their OS details ("arch linux") after `0xbbjoker` was unable to reproduce the issue.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The collaborative spirit of the community was evident in the focused effort to resolve issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031). Contributors `matteo-brandolino`, `0xbbjoker`, and `wtfsayo` actively engaged in a public discussion, sharing diagnostic information, reproduction steps, and potential causes. This interaction highlights a healthy and engaged community working together to solve a complex, environment-dependent problem.
