# elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October was a month dedicated to foundational maintenance and improving the long-term stability of the `plugin-autocoder`. Efforts were centered on modernizing the dependency stack, highlighted by a significant, ecosystem-wide initiative to upgrade to Zod v4. To streamline future maintenance, automated dependency management was introduced via Renovate. A key challenge this month involved collaborative troubleshooting of an import error bug, which was ultimately traced to a specific version of the `@Elizaos/core` package, demonstrating the community's active engagement in maintaining project health.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused exclusively on dependency management and project tooling, with the application version bumped to 1.3.3.

-   **Dependency Modernization & Automation:**
    A major effort was undertaken to keep dependencies current and stable. A pull request ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/pull/1)) was opened to upgrade the project to Zod v4 as part of a broader migration across all ElizaOS plugins ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/5999)). Complementing this manual effort, a Renovate configuration was added ([#2](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/pull/2)) to automate future dependency updates, ensuring the plugin remains secure and up-to-date.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened within this plugin during October, and no issues were closed. The focus remained on investigating existing issues and cross-repository initiatives.

-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in this period.

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    The most significant discussion revolved around issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031), which reported import errors when using Eliza CLI v1.61. The investigation revealed that the problem was not in the plugin itself but was likely caused by incorrect type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specific to version 1.6.1. The issue was found to be resolved by either downgrading or upgrading `@Elizaos/core`, pinpointing a bug in a core dependency. Additionally, issue [#5999](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/5999) tracks the large-scale migration to Zod v4, representing a significant ongoing effort for the entire ElizaOS ecosystem.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both proactive maintenance and reactive problem-solving.

-   The investigation into the Eliza CLI import error ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031)) showcased effective community triage, with `@matteo-brandolino` providing detailed reproduction steps and analysis after `@0xbbjoker` was initially unable to reproduce the bug.
-   The Zod v4 migration ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/5999)), initiated by Stan across 20-25 repositories, highlights a high degree of coordination among maintainers to execute a large-scale, foundational upgrade for the entire project ecosystem.
