### Continued Debugging of Import Errors in Eliza CLI 1.61
Discussion on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031) continued with user @matteo-brandolino providing their operating system details ("arch linux") in response to a query from @wtfsayo. This information is crucial for narrowing down the potential causes of the import errors experienced when using Eliza CLI 1.61. The issue, initially diagnosed by Claude as a problem with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, is still being investigated to understand why it persists for some users despite recommendations to upgrade.
