### Troubleshooting Eliza CLI 1.61 Import Errors [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031)
Discussion continued regarding the `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61` issue. User matteo-brandolino provided their OS as Arch Linux and shared detailed output from `bun x tsc --noEmit`, which showed numerous `TS2305` errors indicating missing exported members from `@elizaos/core`. This output further supported the claim that the issue is specific to version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core` and not present in earlier or later versions. The user also noted that the problem might be related to type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, potentially referencing source files not included in the published package.
