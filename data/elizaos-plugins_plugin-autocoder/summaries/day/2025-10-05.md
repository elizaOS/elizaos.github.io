### Troubleshooting Import Errors in Eliza CLI 1.61
Discussion continued on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031) regarding "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61". On October 5th, `matteo-brandolino` suggested the issue might stem from missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package for version 1.6.1, noting that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using newer versions resolves the problem. This comment followed `0xbbjoker`'s earlier suggestion to check the IDE's TSC compiler and provided steps to re-install dependencies, as they could not reproduce the issue on their end. `matteo-brandolino` had previously confirmed the issue occurs in a newly created project and provided a screenshot of the errors.
