### Eliza CLI 1.61 Import Errors
Discussion on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031) continued, focusing on import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61. The latest comment from matteo-brandolino suggests the issue might stem from incorrect type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically `dist/index.d.ts` and `dist/types/index.d.ts` referencing non-existent source files. Downgrading to version 1.5.15 or upgrading past 1.6.1 reportedly resolves the problem, indicating a potential bug specific to `@Elizaos/core` version 1.6.1. Previously, 0xbbjoker confirmed the issue did not occur on their setup with 1.6.1 and provided troubleshooting steps.
