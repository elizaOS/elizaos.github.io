### Migration to Zod v4
The migration of all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 is underway. Stan has initiated approximately 20-25 PRs across various plugins, including `plugin-autocoder`, to update core, bootstrap, langchain/ai/vercel, and other dependencies to the latest compatible Zod version. ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/5999))

### Imports Not Found with Eliza CLI 1.61
An issue was reported where imports in `index.ts` fail when creating a new project using `elizaos create`. While the project works as expected when running with `elizaos start`, the problem appears to be related to types from the `@Elizaos/core` package. The issue was confirmed to occur on one user's setup, despite working on another's. ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031))
