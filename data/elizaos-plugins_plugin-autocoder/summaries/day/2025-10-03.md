### Eliza CLI Import Errors
Issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031) reports that imports are not found in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61. @0xbbjoker tested the issue and confirmed it works on their side with version 1.6.1, requesting more steps to reproduce. @matteo-brandolino clarified that the issue occurs in a newly created project using `elizaos create` and seems related to types from the `@Elizaos/core` package, despite the project working as expected when run with `elizaos start`.
