      "title": "Improve Farcaster Configuration Handling & API Updates (v1.0.6)",
      "author": "rferrari",
      "number": 13,
      "body": "This PR introduces several improvements to the Farcaster plugin, focusing on enhanced configuration flexibility, updated API method names, optional callback handling, and better test coverage for configuration validation. It also bumps the plugin version to **1.0.6**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Configuration & Credential Handling\r\n- **Prioritize character-level settings** in `config.ts` when resolving Farcaster credentials (`FARCASTER_FID`, `FARCASTER_SIGNER_UUID`, `FARCASTER_NEYNAR_API_KEY`).\r\n- Support credentials provided in `runtime.character.settings` and under `secrets.*` namespaces.\r\n- Added detailed **debug logging** for configuration resolution and validation, making it easier to troubleshoot missing credentials.\r\n- Enhanced `validateFarcasterConfig()` to include structured debug output for key Farcaster parameters.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Test Suite Improvements\r\n- Introduced a **configuration validation test** (`testConfiguration`) to verify the Farcaster setup for each agent at runtime.\r\n- Reworked `FarcasterTestSuite` to dynamically determine whether to run **real or mock tests** based on available credentials.\r\n- Added structured and readable console output for configuration states and credential presence.\r\n- Introduced mock test fallback logic (`credentialedOrMockTest()`) to avoid unnecessary test failures when Farcaster credentials are not provided.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## API Updates & Deprecation Cleanup\r\n- Replaced deprecated method calls:\r\n  - `getPostService` → `getCastService`\r\n  - `createPost` → `createCast`\r\n  - `getPosts` → `getCasts`\r\n- Ensured consistent naming across E2E scenarios for better alignment with the latest Farcaster SDK.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Interaction Handling\r\n- Updated `callback` in `interactions.ts` to make file parameters **optional**, improving flexibility for integrations without attachments.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## E2E Scenarios\r\n- Updated test cases to use `getCastService` and `createCast` consistently.\r\n- Improved error handling and logging for `getMentions()` and `getCasts()` results.\r\n- Added safeguards for mock vs. real testing modes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n| Type | Description |\r\n|------|--------------|\r\n| **feat** | Prioritize character settings in Farcaster configuration |\r\n| **fix** | Make callback files optional |\r\n| **fix** | Replace deprecated Farcaster API methods (`getPosts`, `createPost`, etc.) |\r\n| **chore** | Update plugin version to `1.0.6` |\r\n| **test** | Add configuration validation and mock fallback tests |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n`@elizaos/plugin-farcaster` → **v1.0.6**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Why This Matters\r\nThese changes improve developer experience and plugin stability by:\r\n- Allowing multi agents to define Farcaster credentials directly in character settings.\r\n- Reducing false negatives in tests when environment variables are missing.\r\n- Ensuring alignment with the latest Farcaster SDK changes.\r\n- Simplifying integration testing and debugging workflows.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- **Unit Tests:** All pass successfully  \r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbun run test:unit\r\n$ vitest run __tests__/unit\r\n\r\n RUN  v3.2.4 /projects/plugin-farcaster\r\n\r\n ✓ src/__tests__/unit/common/types.test.ts (29 tests) 26ms\r\n   ✓ Profile Type > should accept valid profile with all properties 2ms\r\n   ✓ Profile Type > should accept profile with only required properties 1ms\r\n   ✓ Profile Type > should handle edge case values 0ms\r\n   ✓ Cast Type > should accept valid cast with all properties 2ms\r\n   ✓ Cast Type > should accept minimal cast with only required properties 1ms\r\n   ✓ Cast Type > should handle empty text and zero stats 1ms\r\n   ✓ CastId Type > should accept valid cast id 0ms\r\n   ✓ CastId Type > should handle empty hash and zero fid 0ms\r\n   ✓ FidRequest Type > should accept valid fid request 1ms\r\n   ✓ FidRequest Type > should handle boundary values 0ms\r\n   ✓ LastCast Interface > should accept valid last cast 0ms\r\n   ✓ LastCast Interface > should handle zero timestamp 0ms\r\n   ✓ FarcasterConfigSchema > should validate complete valid configuration 3ms\r\n   ✓ FarcasterConfigSchema > should apply default values when optional fields are missing 1ms\r\n   ✓ FarcasterConfigSchema > should transform string booleans to actual booleans 1ms\r\n   ✓ FarcasterConfigSchema > should throw error for invalid FARCASTER_FID 2ms\r\n   ✓ FarcasterConfigSchema > should throw error for missing required fields 2ms\r\n   ✓ FarcasterConfigSchema > should throw error for empty required strings 1ms\r\n   ✓ FarcasterEventTypes Enum > should contain all expected event types 1ms\r\n   ✓ FarcasterEventTypes Enum > should have exactly 3 enum values 1ms\r\n   ✓ FarcasterEventTypes Enum > should allow valid enum assignments 0ms\r\n   ✓ FarcasterMessageType Enum > should contain all expected message types 0ms\r\n   ✓ FarcasterMessageType Enum > should have exactly 2 enum values 0ms\r\n   ✓ FarcasterMessageType Enum > should allow valid enum assignments 0ms\r\n   ✓ FarcasterGenericCastPayload Interface > should accept valid payload structure 0ms\r\n   ✓ FarcasterGenericCastPayload Interface > should handle minimal payload structure 0ms\r\n   ✓ Type Integration Tests > should create a complete workflow with all types 0ms\r\n   ✓ Type Integration Tests > should validate configuration with realistic values 0ms\r\n   ✓ Type Integration Tests > should handle edge cases across all types 0ms\r\n\r\n Test Files  1 passed (1)\r\n      Tests  29 passed (29)\r\n   Start at  18:45:41\r\n   Duration  495ms (transform 98ms, setup 0ms, collect 121ms, tests 26ms, environment 0ms, prepare 103ms)\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- **Manual Validation:** Confirmed proper detection of credentials\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n...\r\n Debug      [hasFarcasterEnabled] FID: Found\r\n Debug      [hasFarcasterEnabled] Signer UUID: Found\r\n Debug      [hasFarcasterEnabled] API Key: Found\r\n Debug      [validateFarcasterConfig] Resolved FID: 1\r\n Debug      [validateFarcasterConfig] Resolved Signer UUID: Found\r\n Debug      [validateFarcasterConfig] Resolved API Key: Found\r\n Log        Farcaster Client Configuration:\r\n Log        -
