# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Monthly Report (June 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
June was a month of refinement and alignment for the Farcaster plugin. The most significant effort was a codebase-wide refactoring to adopt Farcaster-native terminology, replacing "post" with "cast" to improve ecosystem consistency. A critical bug related to environment variable configuration was resolved, enhancing usability. Broader architectural discussions took place within the issue tracker, leading to important clarifications on the new channel-based messaging API and the strategic decision to support AWS Bedrock via a dedicated new plugin.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary focus of development work this month was on improving the plugin's internal consistency and documentation.

-   **Farcaster Terminology Refinement:** A significant effort was undertaken to align the plugin's language with the Farcaster ecosystem. This involved a comprehensive refactoring to replace the generic term "post" with the Farcaster-specific term "cast" throughout the codebase, including configurations, tests, and service managers ([#4](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/4), [#3](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/3)). As part of this initiative, docstrings were also added to improve code documentation ([#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/5)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue tracking this month saw the resolution of a key bug, the proposal of a new feature, and active discussions on core platform functionality.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Environment Variable Bug:** An issue preventing the 'post' and 'dryrun' settings from being enabled via the `.env` file was confirmed as fixed and closed ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/1)).
    -   **API Endpoint Confusion:** A user-reported `404` error on the `/api/agents/{agentId}/rooms` endpoint was resolved through clarification. The correct endpoint is now `/api/memory/{agentId}/rooms` as part of a broader architectural shift from "rooms" to "channels" ([#5121](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5121)).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Webhook Integration Proposal:** A new issue was opened to explore using webhooks for initiating messages as an alternative to the current polling mechanism, aiming to improve efficiency ([#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6)).
    -   **Bedrock LLM Integration:** An active discussion on integrating AWS Bedrock ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5117)) culminated in the release of a separate, dedicated `plugin-bedrock`, with a call for community feedback.
    -   **CLI Test Command Limitation:** A new issue was raised concerning the `@elizaos/cli` test command, which currently requires a monorepo structure, preventing E2E tests on standalone projects ([#5142](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5142)).
    -   **Plugin Callback Failures:** An ongoing discussion addresses a problem where callbacks from plugin actions are not reaching the end user in chat, with community members actively troubleshooting potential caching and dependency issues ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5017)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was strong this month, with maintainers and contributors actively engaging in detailed technical discussions to resolve issues and clarify architectural changes.

-   Discussions in issues like Bedrock integration ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5117)) and the API endpoint change ([#5121](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5121)) showcased effective communication, with maintainers like @wtfsayo providing detailed explanations and core contributors like @0xbbjoker and @furkannabisumji driving the conversation forward.
-   Community support was evident in the plugin callback issue ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5017)), where contributors shared debugging steps to help resolve a complex problem.
-   The issue tracker also served as a forum for important announcements, such as the reason for the `agent-twitter-client` repository's removal ([#5074](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5074)), providing valuable context to the community.
