July's activity centered on maintenance and addressing user-reported bugs.

The primary forward-looking development was the creation of a new initiative to update the Neynar SDK, which will enable new features like embed support. Strategically, the team also clarified the deprecation of the `plugin-local-ai` in favor of a more modern Ollama integration.

    - **Client & Plugin Failures:** Two notable issues were closed. A failure to create a Twitter Client ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/36)) was confirmed fixed in the `v1.2.0` update. A separate issue where `plugin-local-ai` failed to load on Windows and Mac ([#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5499)) was also closed, with the resolution being the deprecation of the plugin in favor of Ollama.
