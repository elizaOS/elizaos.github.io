# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July's efforts were centered on issue triage, community support, and planning for future enhancements rather than new code implementation. A key feature requirement was identified to update the Neynar SDK for embed support, setting the stage for future development. Community discussions were instrumental in diagnosing and resolving persistent plugin loading and client creation failures, with fixes communicated through recent version updates. This period also clarified the strategic direction for local AI, with the `plugin-local-ai` being deprecated in favor of Ollama.

Based on the provided reports for July, there were no new features, bug fixes, or code refactoring merged into the main branch. All development activity was focused on discussion and issue management.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **SDK Update Planned:** A new issue ([#7](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/7)) was opened to track the need to update the Neynar SDK to v3, which will enable support for embeds.
