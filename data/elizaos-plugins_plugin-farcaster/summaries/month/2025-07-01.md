# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month focused on maintenance, stability, and community support. While no new features were merged, significant progress was made in resolving user-reported bugs related to plugin loading and client creation. Key discussions led to the strategic decision to deprecate the `plugin-local-ai` in favor of Ollama, streamlining future development. Additionally, planning for future enhancements began with a proposal to update the Neynar SDK.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
There were no new code-based technical developments or merged pull requests during this period. The team's development efforts were concentrated on investigating and resolving issues reported by the community.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was the primary activity in July, with a focus on closing out lingering bugs and planning for future updates.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Plugin Loading & Compatibility:** A critical issue where `plugin-local-ai` failed to load on Windows and Mac (`#5499`) was addressed. After community discussion, the issue was closed with the note that `v1.2.1` contains a fix, and more importantly, that the plugin is being deprecated in favor of Ollama.
    - **Client Creation Failures:** An issue preventing the creation of a Twitter Client (`#36`) was closed after being resolved by the `v1.2.0` update.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **SDK Modernization:** A new issue (`#7`) was opened to track the update of the Neynar SDK to v3. This update is aimed at enabling support for embeds, signaling a move towards richer content integration in the future.
