# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July's development activity centered on maintenance, dependency planning, and community-driven issue resolution. While no new features were merged, significant progress was made in triaging and closing user-reported bugs. Key resolutions included fixing a Twitter client creation failure and clarifying the deprecation of the `plugin-local-ai` in favor of Ollama. The primary forward-looking action was opening an issue to update the Neynar SDK, ensuring the plugin stays current with its dependencies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
There were no new features, bug fixes, or code refactoring efforts merged into the codebase during this period. Development work was focused on investigating and managing issues raised by the community.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was the core activity this month, with several key issues being addressed and resolved through community discussion.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Plugin Loading:** An issue where `plugin-local-ai` failed to load on Windows and Mac ([#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5499)) was closed. The resolution clarified that the plugin is being deprecated in favor of Ollama.
    - **Client Creation:** A bug preventing the creation of a Twitter Client ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/36)) was resolved and closed, with the fix included in the `v1.2.0` update.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **SDK Modernization:** A new issue was opened to plan the update of the Neynar SDK to v3, which notably adds support for embeds ([#7](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/7)). This represents important future work to enhance the plugin's capabilities.
