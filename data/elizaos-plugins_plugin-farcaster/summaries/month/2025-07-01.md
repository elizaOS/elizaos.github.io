# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July's development activity was centered on maintenance and addressing user-reported issues. While no new features were merged, significant progress was made in triaging bugs and planning for future updates. Key discussions led to the resolution of plugin loading and client creation failures. A notable strategic decision was made to deprecate the `plugin-local-ai` in favor of Ollama, and groundwork was laid for a future SDK update to enhance the plugin's capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports, there were no new features, bug fixes, or refactoring efforts merged into the codebase during this period. Development work was focused on issue investigation and planning.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was the primary focus in July, with the community actively reporting and resolving problems.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Plugin & Client Failures:** Two key issues were resolved. A recurring failure to create a Twitter Client ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/36)) was fixed with the `v1.2.0` update. A separate issue where `plugin-local-ai` failed to load on Windows and Mac ([#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5499)) was also closed. The resolution for the latter involved a broader decision to deprecate the plugin, directing users toward an Ollama-based solution.

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **SDK Modernization:** A new issue ([#7](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/7)) was opened to plan an update for the Neynar SDK. The goal is to upgrade to v3 to leverage its support for embeds, indicating a planned enhancement for the plugin's functionality.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was evident in the active issue discussions this month. Users `scottrepreneur` and `yasir23` provided valuable feedback by confirming bugs ([#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5499), [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/36)), which helped guide the maintenance effort. The discussion around the plugin loading issue ([#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5499)) showcased collaboration, with `david-dina` and `ChristopherTrimboli` suggesting workarounds before `wtfsayo` provided a final resolution and strategic direction for the project.
