# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
Based on the available data, July's focus was on maintenance, issue triage, and planning for future enhancements rather than new feature development. Community collaboration was key in diagnosing and resolving several active issues, including plugin loading failures and client creation errors. A significant outcome was the resolution of a persistent loading issue for `plugin-local-ai` (`#5499`), which also clarified the strategic decision to deprecate it in favor of Ollama. A new issue (`#7`) was opened to track an update to the Neynar SDK, signaling upcoming work to improve the plugin's capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
There were no new pull requests, code refactoring, or other direct technical developments reported during this period. All development activity was centered on managing and resolving existing issues.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was the primary activity, with significant progress made on closing out bugs and planning for dependency updates.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Plugin & Client Stability:** Two notable issues were resolved and closed. An issue preventing the creation of a Twitter Client (`#36`) was fixed with the `1.2.0` update. A separate, widely reported issue where `plugin-local-ai` failed to load on Windows and Mac (`#5499`) was also closed. The resolution noted that while a fix exists in `v1.2.1`, the plugin is being deprecated.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **SDK Enhancement:** A new issue (`#7`) was created to update the Neynar SDK, specifically to leverage v3's support for embeds. This represents planned future work for the plugin.
    - **Active Discussion:** The `plugin-local-ai` loading issue (`#5499`) saw active discussion from multiple users, who helped confirm the bug on different operating systems and shared potential workarounds before a fix was identified.
