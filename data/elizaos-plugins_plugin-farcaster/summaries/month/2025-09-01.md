# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This month's activity was centered on identifying a critical performance bottleneck within the Farcaster plugin. No new features or fixes were implemented; instead, the focus shifted entirely to investigation following the discovery of an unexpectedly high volume of database requests. The key event was the opening of issue [#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/8), which reported that the plugin was responsible for over two million PostgreSQL requests in a five-day period, highlighting a significant scalability concern that will likely direct development priorities in the near future.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Based on the provided reports for September, there were no new features, bug fixes, code refactoring efforts, or tests merged into the project. All development efforts appear to have been directed towards investigating the performance issues identified during the month.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The primary focus of the month was on issue management and problem identification rather than resolution.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed in September.
- **New & Active Issues:** The most significant development was the opening of issue [#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/8), which details a severe database performance problem. This issue is now the central point of concern, as the reported request volume is unsustainable and points to a potential architectural flaw in how the plugin interacts with the database.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community interaction this month was characterized by problem reporting rather than code contribution. The opening of issue [#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/8) demonstrates active monitoring and usage of the plugin. There were no pull requests opened or reviewed, and no significant discussion threads were noted in the provided data, indicating a quiet month for direct code collaboration.
