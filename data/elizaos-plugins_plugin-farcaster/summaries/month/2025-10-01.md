# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development efforts centered on foundational project health and stability. Key work involved improving the development infrastructure by introducing automated dependency management via Renovate. A significant portion of the effort was also dedicated to investigating a critical, active issue concerning package imports from `@Elizaos/core`, which impacts developers using a specific version of the core framework.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on improving the project's maintenance and development workflow.

- **Dependency Management Automation:** To ensure the project stays current with its dependencies and reduce manual overhead, Renovate configuration was added in PR [#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/12). This will help automate the process of updating dependencies, contributing to long-term stability.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month was focused on a single, high-impact bug.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed in this period.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. However, significant discussion continued on the active issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6031), "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61". Analysis suggests the problem is isolated to `@Elizaos/core` version 1.6.1 and may be caused by missing source files in the package's type definitions. The current workarounds involve either downgrading to version 1.5.15 or upgrading to a version newer than 1.6.1.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the troubleshooting efforts around the project's dependencies. The discussion on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6031) saw input from community member `matteo-brandolino`, highlighting collaborative problem-solving to diagnose the core issue.
