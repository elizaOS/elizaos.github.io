## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on code refactoring for consistent terminology and addressing a critical bug related to environment variable settings. A new pull request was opened to standardize "post" to "cast" terminology.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Codebase Terminology Refinement:**
    *   Docstrings were added to `refactor/farcaster-post-to-cast-nomenclature` to improve code documentation, as requested by @wtfsayo ([#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/5)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

*   A new pull request, [#3](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/3), was opened to replace 'post' terminology with 'cast' throughout the codebase, aiming for consistent language.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Environment Variable Configuration Fix:**
    *   An issue regarding an error when enabling 'post' and 'dryrun' settings from the `.env` file was closed, with confirmation from @lalalune that it is now fixed ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/1)).

## NEW ISSUES

No new issues were opened on Jun 15, 2025.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Bedrock Integration Discussion:**
    *   The discussion around integrating Bedrock as an LLM continued ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5117)). @wtfsayo initially suggested checking OpenAI plugin environments and later committed to adding a plugin for Bedrock. @furkannabisumji clarified that AWS Bedrock is not OpenAI compatible and later confirmed using a Bedrock gateway for OpenAI compatibility. @0xbbjoker announced the release of a dedicated `plugin-bedrock` and requested feedback.
*   **API Endpoint Not Found for Rooms:**
    *   The issue concerning a 404 error when calling the `/api/agents/{agentId}/rooms` endpoint was actively discussed and resolved ([#5121](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5121)). @wtfsayo clarified that the correct endpoint is `http://localhost:3000/api/memory/{agentId}/rooms` and provided a detailed explanation of the new channel-based messaging API structure, including endpoints for sending messages to and from agents, and how to find channel IDs. @exitsimulation confirmed the helpfulness of the explanation, noting the switch from "rooms" to "channels."
