### Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6031)
The discussion on this issue continued with `matteo-brandolino` confirming their operating system as Arch Linux, in response to `wtfsayo`'s query about the environment. This follows a detailed diagnosis by `claude` on October 7th, which identified the root cause as missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, recommending users upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later.
