### Module Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.6.1
- Discussion continued on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6031) regarding "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61".
- The latest comment from matteo-brandolino suggests the problem might stem from incorrect type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing source files not included in the published package.
