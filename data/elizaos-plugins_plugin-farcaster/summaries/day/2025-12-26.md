# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Daily Update (Dec 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the plugin's ability to process Farcaster casts by adding support for embeds and media, enabling agents to better understand and respond to rich content.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Farcaster Cast Processing
A significant feature was introduced to enable the processing of embeds and media within Farcaster casts. This includes the addition of an `EmbedManager` to handle various embed and media types, improving the agent's comprehension of image and link content within casts. This enhancement involved modifications across several core files, including `src/common/types.ts`, `src/common/utils.ts`, `src/index.ts`, `src/managers/embedManager.ts`, and `src/managers/interactions.ts`. A new script, `scripts/test-embed-processing.ts`, was also added to facilitate testing of this new functionality. ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/16))
