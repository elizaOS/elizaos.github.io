# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Weekly Report (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on planning for future architectural improvements rather than code implementation. While no new code was merged, a significant discussion was initiated around enhancing the plugin's efficiency. The primary focus was on a proposal to integrate webhooks for message initiation, signaling a potential shift from a polling-based system to a more resource-friendly, event-driven approach.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features, bug fixes, or other code changes were merged this week. Development activity was focused on ideation and planning for future work.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The state of project issues saw minimal change, with the focus turning to a new proposal for improving message handling.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved or closed this week.
- **New & Active Issues:** A key new issue, [#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6), was opened to explore webhook integration. This would provide an alternative to the current polling mechanism for initiating new messages, with the goal of improving user experience and reducing resource consumption. An initial comment on the issue suggests this is technically feasible by leveraging the ability of ElizaOS plugins to mount routes directly to the main server.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was concentrated within the discussion on the newly opened issue [#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6). There were no pull requests opened or reviewed, indicating a quiet period for direct code contribution and a greater focus on architectural strategy.
