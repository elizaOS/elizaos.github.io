# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Weekly Report (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on refining the plugin's core terminology and addressing key integration issues. A significant refactoring initiative was undertaken to align the codebase with Farcaster's native language, replacing "post" with "cast" for better ecosystem consistency. Concurrently, a critical bug related to environment variable settings was resolved, and important community discussions clarified major changes to the messaging API and the path forward for AWS Bedrock integration. These activities highlight a focus on improving developer experience, code clarity, and alignment with external platforms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
- **Farcaster Terminology Refinement:** A concerted effort was made to improve the plugin's integration with the Farcaster ecosystem by standardizing its internal language. This refactoring work, tracked across multiple pull requests ([#3](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/3), [#4](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/4)), replaced the generic term "post" with Farcaster's specific term "cast" throughout the codebase. The effort included updating configuration files, tests, service managers, and adding docstrings to improve documentation ([#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/5)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:**
    - A key bug preventing the correct use of 'post' and 'dryrun' settings from the `.env` file was fixed and closed, unblocking users who rely on environment variables for configuration ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/1)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **CLI Test Command Blocker:** A new issue was raised concerning the `@elizaos/cli` test command, which currently requires a monorepo structure, preventing E2E tests from running in standalone projects ([#5142](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5142)).
    - **Bedrock Integration:** Discussion on integrating AWS Bedrock ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5117)) progressed significantly. After clarifying that Bedrock is not directly OpenAI-compatible, @0xbbjoker announced the release of a dedicated `plugin-bedrock` to address the need.
    - **API Endpoint Clarification:** Confusion around a 404 error for the `/api/agents/{agentId}/rooms` endpoint was resolved ([#5121](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5121)). The discussion clarified that the API has shifted to a channel-based system, with the correct endpoint now being `/api/memory/{agentId}/rooms`.
    - **Plugin Callback Bug:** An ongoing issue where callbacks from plugin actions fail to reach the end user in chat continues to be investigated ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5017)).
    - **Service Types Implementation:** It was noted that the implementation of standardized service types and corresponding test services is now complete, marking a major step in modularizing the framework ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/4914)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The week saw strong collaboration between maintainers and the community. Maintainers like @wtfsayo and @0xbbjoker were highly active, providing detailed explanations for API changes ([#5121](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5121)), announcing new plugins to address feature requests ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5117)), and offering debugging support ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5017)). This responsive engagement created a healthy feedback loop, with community members like @exitsimulation and @lalalune confirming fixes and acknowledging the helpfulness of the provided information. The discussion around the deprecated Twitter client ([#5074](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5074)) also served as an important clarification for the community regarding external API constraints.
