# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Weekly Report (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week saw a significant shift from identifying a critical performance bottleneck to implementing a major architectural solution. After a quiet start to the week where a new issue highlighted excessive database requests ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/8)), development surged with a complete refactor of the interaction architecture. The introduction of webhook support ([#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/11)) marks a pivotal move away from polling, aiming to enhance real-time responsiveness and reduce operational costs. This foundational work was supported by crucial build fixes and an SDK update, stabilizing the project for future development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week was focused on a major architectural enhancement and ensuring project stability.

- **Enhanced Interaction Architecture with Webhook Support**
  A significant architectural refactor was completed to introduce webhook support as an alternative to polling ([#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/11)). This change fundamentally improves the plugin's real-time responsiveness and addresses cost and performance concerns associated with high-frequency polling. The entire interaction processing system was reworked to accommodate this new, more efficient event-driven model.

- **Build Fixes and Dependency Updates**
  To ensure project health, a critical build error was resolved, allowing the project to compile correctly ([#9](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/9)). Alongside this fix, the SDK was updated, requiring changes across core files like the client, callbacks, types, and managers to maintain compatibility ([#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/10)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week centered on identifying a new performance issue and continuing discussion on existing items.

- **Closed Issues:**
  No issues were closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Database Performance:** A key issue, [#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/8), was opened, reporting an unexpectedly high number of PostgreSQL requests (over 2 million in 5 days). This highlights a significant performance concern, which the new webhook architecture aims to address.
  - **Alpha Version Notifications:** Discussion continued in [#5971](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5971) regarding how "update available" notifications are handled for alpha versions. The latest comment indicates a contributor may address it if time permits.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Development activity was concentrated mid-week following a quiet period. While there were no PRs with heavy discussion, the work completed represents a focused effort to address a community-reported performance issue ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/8)) with a significant architectural change. The primary visible community interaction was the ongoing discussion around update notifications in issue [#5971](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5971).
