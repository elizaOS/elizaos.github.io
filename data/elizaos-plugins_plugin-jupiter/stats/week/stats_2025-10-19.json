      "author": "MonteCrypto999",
      "number": 3,
      "body": "# PR: Optional Referral Fees on Jupiter Legacy Swap\r\n\r\nThis PR adds **optional referral fees** on *Jupiter Legacy Swap* via `platformFeeBps` and `feeAccount`,\r\nwith clean **env-based config**, **tests**, and **runnable E2E examples** (simulation/signing).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🧩 Features\r\n\r\n### Referral Fees\r\n\r\n* Adds `platformFeeBps` to `/quote` when `REFERRAL_FEE_BPS > 0`.\r\n* Derives `feeAccount` as the **ATA for the chosen mint** from `REFERRAL_FEE_RECEIVER`.\r\n* **Modes:**\r\n\r\n  * `sol_only`: collect fees only if SOL/WSOL is in the pair.\r\n  * `smart`: prefer SOL if available, else input mint.\r\n* Respects **ExactIn / ExactOut** rules and skips fees if constraints aren’t met.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🧠 Code Changes\r\n\r\n* **`src/service.ts`**\r\n\r\n  * Integrates `platformFeeBps` in quote and `feeAccount` in swap.\r\n  * Handles mint selection and fee receiver ATA derivation.\r\n* **`src/__tests__/integration.test.ts`**\r\n\r\n  * Live-mode tests against Jupiter API (referral on/off, custom mint sample).\r\n* **`src/scripts/e2e-mainnet.ts`**\r\n\r\n  * E2E script using `.env` (can simulate and sign/send).\r\n* **`local-e2e/` (gitignored)**\r\n\r\n  * Local simulator for build/quote/swap, simulate, and sign via **Helius RPC**.\r\n* **Docs & Config**\r\n\r\n  * `README.md` and `env.example`: updated with clear config and E2E instructions.\r\n  * `.gitignore`: ignores `local-e2e` and env files.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ⚙️ How to Use\r\n\r\n### 1. Setup Environment\r\n\r\nCopy `.env.example` → `.env` and set:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nREFERRAL_FEE_BPS=20\r\nREFERRAL_MODE=sol_only\r\nREFERRAL_FEE_RECEIVER=<fee receiver public key>\r\nTEST_INPUT_MINT=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112\r\nTEST_OUTPUT_MINT=Dz9mQ9NzkBcCsuGPFJ3r1bS4wgqKMHBPiVuniW8Mbonk\r\nTEST_INPUT_AMOUNT_ATOMIC=5000000      # 0.005 SOL\r\nTEST_SLIPPAGE_BPS=150\r\n# Optional (for simulation/signing)\r\nHELIUS_RPC_URL=<url>\r\nSIGNER_SECRET_KEY=[…]\r\nSEND_TX=0\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. Run E2E Example\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm run build && node dist/scripts/e2e-mainnet.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. Local Simulator (ignored, for ops/dev)\r\n\r\nPopulate `local-e2e/.env.local` as above, then run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm run local:sim\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🧩 Notes & Edge Cases\r\n\r\n* **Error “Invalid token account / 0x1789 (6025)”**\r\n  Usually a route/account issue.\r\n  Ensure the **fee receiver’s ATA exists** for the selected mint (e.g., WSOL in `sol_only` mode).\r\n  If absent, create the ATA or let Jupiter create it idempotently.\r\n  Some routes may still fail in simulation—try higher slippage or another route.\r\n\r\n* **No Referral Program needed** for Legacy Swap.\r\n  (Still required for Trigger API.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🔗 References\r\n\r\n* [[Jupiter Docs – Add Fees to Swap](https://dev.jup.ag/docs/swap/add-fees-to-swap)](https://dev.jup.ag/docs/swap/add-fees-to-swap)\r\n* [[ElizaOS – Create a Plugin](https://docs.elizaos.ai/guides/create-a-plugin)](https://docs.elizaos.ai/guides/create-a-plugin)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ✅ Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] Referral fee applied only when `REFERRAL_FEE_BPS > 0` and valid `feeAccount`\r\n* [x] `feeAccount` derived from `REFERRAL_FEE_RECEIVER` ATA for selected mint\r\n* [x] Live integration tests against Jupiter API\r\n* [x] E2E script with simulation/signing (HELIUS RPC)\r\n* [x] `README` and `.env.example` updated\r\n* [x] Local-only utilities ignored by git\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **New Features**\n  * Referral fee support with configurable fee modes and fee-account handling; JupiterService exposed at package root.\n\n* **Documentation**\n  * Expanded README with features, installation, configuration, examples, and API usage.\n  * Added environment example template for referral and e2e setup.\n\n* **Tests**\n  * Added integration and referral tests plus an end-to-end mainnet test script.\n\n* **Chores**\n  * Updated ignore patterns and package scripts/dependencies.\n\n* **CI**\n  * Reworked release/publish workflows and release tooling configuration.\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
