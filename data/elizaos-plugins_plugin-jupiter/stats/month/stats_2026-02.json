      "author": "odilitime",
      "number": 4,
      "body": "lite-api.jup.ag no longer works; basic tier now requires an API key. Reads JUPITER_API_KEY from runtime settings and sends x-api-key header on all quote and swap requests. Also adds build.ts, tsconfig.build.json, expanded .gitignore, and various type annotation fixes.\n\n<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\n---\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **Medium Risk**\n> Changes core swap/quote networking and startup behavior (API-key gating, headers, rate-limited queues) and adjusts pricing/token endpoints, which could break runtime functionality if configuration or API responses differ.\n> \n> **Overview**\n> Migrates all Jupiter HTTP calls to `https://api.jup.ag` and adds `x-api-key` auth via `JUPITER_API_KEY` (service now refuses to start without it), with shared per-process 1 RPS quote/swap queues that start on service `start()` instead of at module import.\n> \n> Adds a TTL+size-bounded route cache keyed by `inputMint/outputMint/amount`, updates token metadata and price lookups to newer Jupiter endpoints, and tightens a handful of types/amount parsing.\n> \n> Replaces the `tsup` build script with a Bun `build.ts` pipeline (clean, ESM build, then `.d.ts` generation via new `tsconfig.build.json`) and expands `.gitignore` for common build/cache/env artifacts.\n> \n> <sup>Written by [Cursor Bugbot](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot) for commit 15a2f0dd2afccd3799aca371aa3564ff9824a446.

Build system changes are functional despite minor issues with watch mode and dead code.\n- Pay close attention to `src/service.ts` - verify that `getTokenPair` and `getHistoricalPrices` work with the old endpoint or need migration\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| src/service.ts | Updates to api.jup.ag with API key auth; two methods still use old public.jupiterapi.com endpoint |\n| build.ts | New Bun-based build script; contains unreachable dead code in conditional branch |\n| package.json | Switches from tsup to custom build.ts; dev script references unimplemented --watch flag |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client as JupiterService\n    participant API as api.jup.ag\n    participant Queue as Request Queue\n    \n    Note over Client: Service starts, reads API key from settings\n    Client->>Client: Load API key configuration\n    \n    Note over Client,API: Quote Request Flow\n    Client->>Queue: quoteEnqueue(url)\n    Queue->>Queue: Add to quotes queue\n    Queue->>API: GET /swap/v1/quote (with auth header)\n    API-->>Queue: Quote response\n    Queue-->>Client: Return quote data\n    \n    Note over Client,API: Swap Request Flow\n    Client->>Queue: swapEnqueue(url, payload)\n    Queue->>Queue: Add to swaps queue\n    Queue->>API: POST /swap/v1/swap (with auth header)\n    API-->>Queue: Swap transaction data\n    Queue-->>Client: Return swap data\n    \n    Note over Queue: Queues process at 1 req/sec<br/>with exponential backoff on 429\n```\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
