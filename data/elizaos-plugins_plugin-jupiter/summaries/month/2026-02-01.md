# elizaos-plugins/plugin-jupiter Monthly Report (February 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
In February 2026, development for the Jupiter plugin focused on enhancing the robustness and flexibility of its core integrations. The primary achievement was the transition toward a more stable API infrastructure, moving away from the lite-api in favor of the official Jupiter V6 API. This shift, coupled with the introduction of API key authentication, signifies a move toward production-grade security and reliability. Additionally, the project began addressing community needs for greater provider flexibility, specifically regarding custom endpoint support for AI services.

## 🛠️️ Key Developments

### API Infrastructure & Security
The project initiated a significant refactor of its communication layer to ensure more reliable transaction processing and data retrieval.
*   **Migration to api.jup.ag:** Work began on switching the plugin's integration from `lite-api` to the standard `api.jup.ag` endpoint. This change is designed to provide a more stable foundation for Solana-based swaps and price discovery.
*   **Authentication Enhancements:** Alongside the API migration, the plugin incorporated API key authentication. This update ([#4](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-jupiter/pull/4)) enhances security and ensures the plugin can operate within the rate limits and requirements of the official Jupiter API.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### New & Active Issues
The community is currently focused on expanding the interoperability of the plugin's underlying AI providers.
*   **Custom OpenAI Endpoints:** Significant discussion persists regarding the ability to support custom OpenAI endpoint URLs ([#6490](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-jupiter/issues/6490)). This feature is highly requested as it would allow users to integrate the plugin with various OpenAI-compatible third-party services (such as Arko Studio). The technical consensus suggests that implementing a configurable `base_url` would be sufficient to unlock compatibility with a wide range of distributed and free API providers.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The month's activity highlights an active dialogue between maintainers and users regarding the extensibility of the framework. Contributors like **arcaela** have been instrumental in advocating for modularity, specifically pointing out how small technical changes—like allowing custom base URLs—can significantly lower the barrier to entry for developers using third-party AI services. This collaboration reflects the project's core philosophy of decentralization and open collaboration by ensuring the plugin remains adaptable to diverse technical ecosystems.
