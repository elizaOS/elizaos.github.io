# elizaos-plugins/plugin-jupiter Weekly Report (Feb 8 - 14, 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week, development focused on enhancing the robustness and security of the Jupiter plugin's core infrastructure. The primary achievement was the transition toward a more stable API integration by migrating from the `lite-api` to the official `api.jup.ag` endpoint. This shift, coupled with the introduction of API key authentication, marks a significant step in ensuring the plugin meets production-grade standards for ElizaOS agents operating within the Solana ecosystem.

## 🛠️️ Key Developments

### API Infrastructure & Security
The project initiated a critical refactor of its external communication layer to improve reliability and access to Jupiter's full feature set.
*   **Migration to Official Jupiter API:** A major pull request was opened to switch the plugin's integration from `lite-api` to `api.jup.ag` ([#4](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-jupiter/pull/4)). 
*   **Authentication Implementation:** As part of this migration, the plugin now incorporates API key authentication. This change is designed to provide enhanced security and ensure more consistent rate limits and functionality for users.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### New & Active Issues
The community is currently focused on expanding the flexibility of the plugin's underlying AI configurations.
*   **Custom Endpoint Support:** Discussion continued regarding the support for custom OpenAI endpoint URLs ([#6490](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-jupiter/issues/6490)). This feature is highly anticipated as it would allow the plugin to remain compatible with various OpenAI-compatible third-party services. 
*   **Testing Alternatives:** Within the active issue discussions, contributors have suggested utilizing services like Arko Studio as free alternatives for testing these custom configurations, indicating a community-driven effort to lower the barrier for developer experimentation.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week's activity highlights an active dialogue between maintainers and contributors regarding the plugin's extensibility. The discussion on issue [#6490](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-jupiter/issues/6490) by contributors like arcaela demonstrates a collaborative approach to defining the project's roadmap, specifically focusing on making the plugin more adaptable to diverse infrastructure needs. The move toward a standardized API integration in PR [#4](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-jupiter/pull/4) reflects a shared commitment to professionalizing the plugin's architecture for the broader ElizaOS ecosystem.
