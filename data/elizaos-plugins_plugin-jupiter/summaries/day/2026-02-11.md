Discussion continued on [#6490](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-jupiter/issues/6490), a feature request to support custom OpenAI endpoint URLs for the OpenAI provider. A new comment from arcaela emphasized the importance of this feature for enabling compatibility with various OpenAI-compatible third-party services, such as Arko Studio, which offers free API keys.
