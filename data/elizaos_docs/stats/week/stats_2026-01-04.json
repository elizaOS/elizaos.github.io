      "body": "## Context\nUsers struggle with agent memory/recall configuration. Need clearer guidance on \"knowledge\" and \"lore\" sections in agent JSON.\n\n- **Source**: Discord discussion (2026-01-03)\n- **Priority**: P2 (from issue-triage assessment)\n- **Impact**: High (recurring onboarding pain; \"memory doesn't work\" complaints)\n\n## Evidence\n- Discord: Users asking \"How should knowledge and lore sections be added to JSON configurations?\"\n- Open question in daily facts: \"How should knowledge and lore sections be added to JSON configurations to improve agent memory/recall?\"\n- Pattern: Configuration discoverability problems across multiple reports\n\n## Technical Details\n- **Component**: Docs + Agent configuration schema\n- **Complexity**: 2/5 (primarily documentation work)\n- **Required Expertise**: Agent config schema, technical writing, examples\n\n## Proposed Implementation\n1. Create docs page: \"Configuring Agent Memory: Knowledge & Lore Guide\"\n2. Include working JSON examples for both `knowledge` and `lore` sections\n3. Explain the difference between knowledge (factual) and lore (personality/backstory)\n4. Add schema validation guidance (what's required vs optional)\n5. Include troubleshooting section for common memory issues\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Documentation page exists with clear examples\n- [ ] Both knowledge and lore sections covered\n- [ ] At least one working agent template with memory configured\n- [ ] FAQ/troubleshooting section included\n\n---\nGenerated from [elizaOS intelligence pipeline](https://github.com/elizaOS/knowledge)\nEvidence date: 2026-01-06",
