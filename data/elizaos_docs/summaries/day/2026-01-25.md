## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Project Generation Failure and CLI Installation Guidance
Issue [#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6388), "Can not generate project," was actively discussed and resolved today. The user initially reported errors when running `elizaos create` after following the documentation. After some troubleshooting, including checking the ElizaOS version, a temporary workaround was provided by `standujar` to use `bun -i g @elizaos/cli` due to a broken wrapper. Subsequently, `standujar` also linked to a pull request ([#83](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83)) that addressed the documentation update, and the user confirmed the fix was working.
