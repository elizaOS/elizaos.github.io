# elizaos/docs Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the documentation saw significant updates with the addition of a dedicated launch resources page and a comprehensive renaming of the API Reference to REST Reference for improved clarity and developer understanding.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Builder Resources & Documentation Structure
A new "Launch Resources" page has been added, consolidating all essential builder information previously found on build.elizaos.ai directly into the documentation. This update also involved removing an outdated development page, streamlining access to critical resources for builders. ([#76](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/76))

### API Reference Renaming for Clarity
The "API Reference" section has been systematically renamed to "REST Reference" across the documentation. This change provides a more accurate and intuitive naming convention, enhancing developer understanding and navigation, particularly within the messaging, agents, memory, audio, and logs sections. ([#75](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/75))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CLI Installation Module Error
An issue, [#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6088), was reported regarding a `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` error after installing the ElizaOS CLI. Users are experiencing this when running `elizaos --version`. A workaround has been identified: cloning the repository and building from source, then aliasing the local CLI. The root cause appears to be a bundling issue in the published npm package. A fix has been implemented in version 1.6.3, and users are confirming it resolves the problem after re-running `bun install -g @elizaos/cli`.

### Plugin Documentation Inaccuracies
Issue [#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6070) highlights significant inaccuracies and difficulties in the plugin documentation, preventing users from successfully scaffolding plugins. Initial frustration from a user led to a detailed analysis and fix by Claude. The core problems identified were incorrect CLI command syntax (`-t` instead of `--type`) and issues with template lookup paths. Claude implemented fixes by adding fallback paths for templates and correcting CLI command syntax in multiple README files and CLI source code. The user who initially reported the issue has been engaged for further feedback on their specific challenges.
