# elizaos/docs Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the documentation saw significant updates with the addition of a new "Launch Resources" page, consolidating builder information, and a comprehensive renaming of "API Reference" to "REST Reference" for improved clarity.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Structure and Content Expansion
*   A new "Launch Resources" page was added, migrating all relevant builder resources from the now-deprecated build.elizaos.ai, making them directly accessible within the documentation. An old, unused page was also removed. ([#76](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/76))

### API Reference Renaming for Clarity
*   The "API Reference" section was renamed to "REST Reference" across numerous files to align with better naming conventions for documentation and developer understanding, as requested by ticket ELIZA-714. ([#75](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/75))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Plugin Documentation Improvements
*   The issue regarding incorrect plugin documentation and scaffolding problems was closed. This was resolved by fixing template lookup paths and correcting CLI command syntax in various README files and CLI command definitions. ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6070))

## NEW ISSUES
### CLI Module Resolution Error
*   A new issue was reported concerning a "Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'" error when installing the ElizaOS CLI, indicating a potential bundling problem with the npm package. ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6088))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Plugin Documentation Inaccuracies ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6070))
The discussion on this issue highlighted significant frustration from a user regarding the state of plugin documentation and scaffolding. The user, @ryanmstokes, reported spending a week trying to use the framework with "endless issues" and deemed the documentation "bad." @yungalgo engaged with the user, apologizing for the frustration and requesting more specific details about the challenges faced, including the operating system, model provider, and database used, to better understand and address the issues. @ryanmstokes committed to providing detailed feedback. The issue was ultimately closed after an AI agent, Claude, provided a detailed fix, identifying and resolving root causes such as incorrect template lookup paths and CLI command syntax errors in various documentation files.

### CLI Module Resolution Error ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6088))
The user, @schmidsi, reported an error "Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'" after installing the ElizaOS CLI. Further investigation by @schmidsi revealed that building the CLI from source works correctly, suggesting the root cause is a bundling issue in the published npm package. A workaround was provided: aliasing the CLI to the local build's executable.
