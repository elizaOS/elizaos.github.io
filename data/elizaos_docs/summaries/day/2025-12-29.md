### Migration and Wallet Connection Support
A community member, om1d-sa, provided detailed advice on issue [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6211) regarding a Snapshot Eligibility Issue and Tangem Wallet Connection. The advice offered two options: importing a cold wallet seed phrase into a hot wallet for self-migration, or joining the official Discord server to use the ticket system for manual migration, emphasizing verification of official support team members. This comment was in response to a previous inquiry about the issue's resolution.
