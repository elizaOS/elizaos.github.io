### Snapshot Eligibility and Wallet Connection Challenges
Discussion continued on [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6211), which addresses a user's difficulties with the AI16Z to ElizaOS migration due to a Snapshot Eligibility Issue and unsupported Tangem Wallet connection. A community member, om1d-sa, provided advice on two potential solutions:
*   Importing a cold wallet's seed phrase into a hot wallet like Phantom for self-migration.
*   Joining the official Discord server and using the ticket system for manual migration, emphasizing verification of official support team members.
