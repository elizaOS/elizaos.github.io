# elizaos/docs Weekly Report (Jan 25 - 31, 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week focused on streamlining the onboarding experience for new developers by resolving critical friction points in the CLI installation process. The primary achievement was the correction of the project generation workflow, which had been obstructed by outdated documentation regarding package naming. By aligning the documentation with the current scoped package structure, the team successfully restored the "create" functionality for the community, ensuring a smoother entry point into the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### CLI Installation & Onboarding Refinement
The core technical focus was ensuring that the initial setup process for ElizaOS is functional and accurate.
*   **Scoped Package Updates:** The documentation was updated to reflect the correct scoped package name for the CLI. This change ensures that users running installation commands pull the correct binaries required for project initialization.
*   **Command Correction:** Documentation now correctly directs users to the functional installation path, resolving a "broken wrapper" issue that previously prevented the `elizaos create` command from executing properly. These improvements were finalized in [#83](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
*   **Project Generation Failures:** The team successfully resolved a high-priority blocker, [#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6388), where users were unable to generate new projects. The investigation revealed that the documentation was pointing to an incorrect CLI installation command. By updating the guidance to use the scoped `@elizaos/cli` package, the issue was fully mitigated.

### New & Active Issues
*   The activity this week was concentrated on the resolution of the project generation failure. No new major blockers or issues were reported following the deployment of the documentation fix, suggesting a stabilization of the installation workflow.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week demonstrated an efficient feedback loop between the community and maintainers. The resolution of the CLI issue was a collaborative effort:
*   **Rapid Troubleshooting:** User reports regarding the `elizaos create` failure were met with active troubleshooting from the community and maintainers.
*   **Contributor Impact:** Contributor `standujar` played a pivotal role in diagnosing the broken wrapper and providing an immediate workaround (`bun -i g @elizaos/cli`) before formalizing the fix via a pull request.
*   **Validation:** The fix was verified by the reporting users, confirming that the documentation update successfully restored functionality for the broader community.
