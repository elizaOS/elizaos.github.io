## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this week centered on addressing existing user problems rather than closing tickets or introducing new ones.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week according to the provided data.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. Discussion continued on the active issue [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6211), which concerns user difficulties with the AI16Z to ElizaOS migration. The specific challenges reported are a Snapshot Eligibility Issue and the lack of support for the Tangem Wallet.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was evident in the active discussion surrounding issue [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6211). Community member `om1d-sa` provided significant support by suggesting two potential workarounds for the user's migration problem:
1.  Importing the cold wallet's seed phrase into a supported hot wallet like Phantom to perform a self-migration.
2.  Contacting the official support team via the Discord server's ticket system for a manual migration.

This interaction demonstrates valuable peer-to-peer support within the ElizaOS community, helping users navigate complex issues.
