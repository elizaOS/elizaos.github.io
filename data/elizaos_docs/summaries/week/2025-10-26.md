# elizaos/docs Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's efforts in the `elizaos/docs` repository were centered on expanding and refining the documentation to better support our users and community. The most significant addition was a comprehensive guide covering x402 payment integration and Nginx deployment, providing crucial information for users setting up their own instances. Alongside this, work was done to enhance community engagement by making the project's Discord server more prominent. These updates aim to improve both the technical onboarding process and the collaborative health of the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on adding new technical guides and improving the user experience of the documentation site itself.

- **Community & User Experience Enhancements**
  - To foster greater community participation, a prominent call-to-action to join the project's Discord was added to the documentation site ([#78](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/78)).
