# elizaos/docs Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on enhancing documentation clarity and addressing critical user feedback. Key updates include the creation of a centralized "Launch Resources" page and renaming the API Reference to "REST Reference" for better consistency ([#75](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/75), [#76](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/76)). A significant issue with plugin scaffolding documentation was resolved, leveraging an AI agent to correct template paths and CLI commands ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6070)). However, a new high-priority bug has been identified that prevents the CLI from running after a standard npm installation ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6088)).

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on restructuring and refining the documentation to improve the developer experience.

- **Content Centralization and Naming Consistency:** To provide builders with a single source of truth, a new "Launch Resources" page was created, consolidating forms and information previously hosted on `build.elizaos.ai`. An old, unused page was also removed to streamline the site ([#76](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/76)). For better clarity and alignment with standard conventions, the "API Reference" was renamed to "REST Reference" across the documentation, fulfilling a request from ticket ELIZA-714 ([#75](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/75)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** A critical issue regarding faulty plugin documentation was resolved ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6070)). After a user reported significant frustration with plugin scaffolding, an AI agent (Claude) was used to identify and fix several underlying problems, including incorrect template paths and CLI command syntax in README files. The fix ensures users can now successfully scaffold plugins by following the updated documentation.

- **New & Active Issues:** A new, potentially blocking issue was reported that prevents the elizaOS CLI from running after a standard npm installation ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6088)). The error, `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'`, appears to stem from a bundling problem in the published npm package, as building the CLI from source resolves the dependency correctly. This is a high-priority bug for new user onboarding.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted constructive engagement with the community around documentation pain points. In issue [#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6070), a maintainer (@yungalgo) effectively de-escalated a user's significant frustration with the plugin scaffolding process, leading to a productive exchange. The resolution of this issue was also notable for its use of an AI agent, Claude, to identify and fix bugs, demonstrating the project's core philosophy in practice. Additionally, the detailed bug report and initial diagnosis provided by a user for the new CLI installation error ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6088)) showcases a technically engaged community actively contributing to problem-solving.
