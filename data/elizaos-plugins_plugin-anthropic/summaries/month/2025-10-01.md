# elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development activity focused on improving project infrastructure and diagnosing a critical dependency issue. A key step was taken to automate dependency management with the introduction of a Renovate configuration. Concurrently, significant progress was made in triaging a module import error affecting users of Eliza CLI v1.6.1, with community collaboration leading to the identification of a potential root cause within the `@Elizaos/core` package.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on foundational maintenance to ensure long-term project stability and security.

- **Infrastructure and Maintenance Automation**
  To streamline dependency management, a pull request ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/8)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration file. This will automate the process of keeping project dependencies up-to-date, reducing manual effort and helping to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was a primary focus, with significant discussion on a high-impact bug.

- **Closed Issues:**
  No issues were closed based on the provided reports.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  No new issues were opened, but a critical active issue saw significant diagnostic progress:
  - **Module Import Errors with Eliza CLI ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/issues/6031))**: Discussion on this issue identified a likely cause for the "Imports not found in index.ts" error. It appears to be specific to users on `@Elizaos/core` version 1.6.1 and may stem from incorrect type definition files in that package release. It was noted that downgrading or upgrading from this specific version serves as a temporary workaround.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was evident in the collaborative troubleshooting of active issues. The discussion on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/issues/6031) involved multiple contributors, including `matteo-brandolino` and `0xbbjoker`, who worked together to investigate the problem, share findings, and identify a potential root cause related to an upstream dependency. This highlights the community's active role in maintaining the health of the ecosystem.
