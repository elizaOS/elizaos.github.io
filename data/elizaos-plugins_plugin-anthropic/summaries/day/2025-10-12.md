# elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic Daily Update (Oct 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant code refactoring to improve modularity and maintainability, alongside a crucial bug fix for TypeScript compilation errors.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Plugin Architecture Refactoring
- The monolithic `index.ts` file was split into a modular directory structure, enhancing organization and scalability.
- Dedicated directories were created for `models` (with `text.ts` and `object.ts` handlers), `providers` (for the Anthropic client factory), and `utils` (for config and event handling). ([#9](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/9))

### TypeScript Compilation Fixes
- Added `@types/node` as a `devDependency` to resolve TypeScript compilation errors related to `process.env` usage.
- Updated `tsconfig.json` to include `"types": ["node"]`, ensuring proper Node.js type definitions are available. ([#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/10))
