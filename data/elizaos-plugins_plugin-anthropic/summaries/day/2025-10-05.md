### Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/issues/6031))
Discussions continued regarding import errors when using Eliza CLI 1.61. A user, matteo-brandolino, provided further details, suggesting the issue might be related to type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing source files that may not be included in the published package. They noted that downgrading to version 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem, indicating a potential bug specific to version 1.6.1. They also shared the output of `bun x tsc --noEmit`, which showed 28 errors across 4 files, primarily related to missing exported members from `@elizaos/core`.
