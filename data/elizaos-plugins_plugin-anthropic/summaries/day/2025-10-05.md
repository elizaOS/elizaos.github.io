## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61
Discussion continued on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/issues/6031), which reports import errors in `index.ts` when using `elizaos create` with Eliza CLI 1.6.1. The latest comment from matteo-brandolino suggests the issue might stem from missing source files referenced in the type definition files of the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically in version 1.6.1. Downgrading to 1.5.15 or upgrading to versions newer than 1.6.1 reportedly resolves the problem, indicating a potential bug specific to that version.
