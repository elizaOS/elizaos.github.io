### Investigation into `@elizaos/core` Import Errors ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/issues/6031))
Discussion continued on the `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61` issue. The latest comment from @matteo-brandolino confirmed the operating system as Arch Linux, in response to @wtfsayo's query about the environment. Previously, a detailed diagnosis by Claude identified the root cause as missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, suggesting it's a build/publish pipeline issue specific to that version. Recommendations included upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later and considering deprecating v1.6.1 on npm.
