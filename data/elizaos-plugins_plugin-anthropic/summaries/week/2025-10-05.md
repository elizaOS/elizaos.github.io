# elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity was focused on infrastructure improvement and critical bug investigation rather than new feature development. A pull request was opened to introduce Renovate for automated dependency management, aiming to improve long-term repository health. The primary focus, however, was a collaborative deep-dive into a significant import error affecting users of Eliza CLI v1.6.1. This investigation successfully identified the root cause as a build pipeline issue in the `@elizaos/core` package, leading to clear recommendations for users and maintainers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the project's maintenance and stability.

- **Dependency Management Automation:** A pull request ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/8)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration. This initiative aims to automate the process of keeping project dependencies up-to-date, reducing manual maintenance overhead and ensuring the plugin stays current with its ecosystem.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No new issues were opened and no issues were closed this week. All activity was concentrated on a single, critical active issue.

- **New & Active Issues:** The main focus was on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/issues/6031), concerning import errors with Eliza CLI v1.6.1.
    - **Diagnosis:** A detailed investigation concluded that the root cause was a build/publish pipeline problem in `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1, which resulted in missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files.
    - **Impact:** The issue is specific to version 1.6.1 and blocks users on that version from successfully using the plugin.
    - **Resolution:** The recommended fix is for users to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or a newer version. It was also suggested that the project consider deprecating the faulty v1.6.1 on npm to prevent further adoption.
