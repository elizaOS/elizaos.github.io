Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch.
