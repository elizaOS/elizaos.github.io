  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Feb 12, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day focused on maintenance with a minor changelog update. Several long-standing issues related to scenario testing and evaluators were closed, indicating progress in refining the testing framework.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Changelog Maintenance:**\n    *   Removed all references from the `CHANGELOG.md` file. ([#6495](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6495))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n*   **Enhanced Scenario Testing Capabilities:**\n    *   Closed an issue addressing the need for runtime method mocking to enable deterministic agent testing, particularly for LLM interactions. This will improve the reliability of scenario tests.
