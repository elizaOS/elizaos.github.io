  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Feb 14, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw no new code contributions, but two new issues were opened, both proposing the addition of a Verifiable Audit Trail Plugin (VAL) to enhance the tamper-proof record-keeping of Eliza agents.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new technical developments were completed today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Proposal for Verifiable Audit Trail Plugin (VAL)\nTwo new issues, [#6499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6499) and [#6500](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6500), were opened, both proposing the implementation of a Verifiable Audit Trail Plugin (VAL). The core problem identified is the current mutability and local-only nature of Eliza agent logs, which necessitates trust in the agent operator. The proposed solution aims to introduce a verifiable and tamper-proof record of agent actions.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Image Content Stripped from LLM Requests\nIssue [#6494](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6494), concerning image content being stripped from LLM requests in cloud chat, received an update. A developer has volunteered to work on this issue, stating, \"You can assign this to me, will be working on it asap!\" This indicates active engagement and an upcoming resolution for the problem identified within `/api/v1/chat/completions` and `convertToUIMessages`."
