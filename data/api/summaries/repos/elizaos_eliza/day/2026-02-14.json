The core problem identified is the current mutability and local-only nature of Eliza agent logs, which necessitates trust in the agent operator. The proposed solution aims to introduce verifiable, tamper-proof records of agent actions.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues had more than 3 comments today."
