  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Feb 9, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday saw significant progress in core infrastructure and plugin integration, with several key issues closed related to user session management, memory persistence, and OAuth integrations. New issues were opened concerning a URL processing bug, Renovate configuration, and a UI enhancement.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new technical developments were completed today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Core Infrastructure & User Management\nSeveral critical infrastructure issues were closed, enhancing user session isolation, memory persistence, and generic webhook services. This includes implementing isolated user sessions for multi-tenant architecture [#6409](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6409), ensuring Eliza remembers conversations and user preferences across sessions [#6411](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6411), and building a generic webhook service for stateless messaging plugins [#6430](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6430).\n\n### Plugin & Integration Enhancements\nSignificant progress was made on plugin and integration capabilities, including dynamic plugin loading, calendar integration, and Microsoft OAuth. This involved configuring dynamic plugin loading based on user needs [#6403](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6403), enabling Eliza to manage Google Calendar events [#6405](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6405), and integrating Microsoft OAuth for Outlook calendar and email support [#6453](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6453).\n\n### Agent Security & OAuth Management\nSecurity and OAuth management for agents were addressed, with a focus on sandboxing and preventing duplicate OAuth connections. This includes setting up a security sandbox for the auto agent VPS and Twitter integration [#6434](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6434), and enforcing single OAuth connections per platform per user while linking Eliza App users to Cloud users [#6462](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6462).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Critical Bug & Configuration Issues\nA critical bug was reported regarding duplicate LLM calls when a URL is present in a message, and an action is required to fix the Renovate configuration.\n- A URL in a message triggers duplicate LLM calls, processing it as both text and an attachment, leading to two responses [#6486](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6486).\n- The Renovate configuration has an error that needs to be resolved, as it is preventing new pull requests [#6488](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6488).\n\n### UI/UX Enhancements\nA new UI enhancement request was made to add Discord as a messaging option on the landing site.\n- Add Discord as a fourth messaging option on the Eliza App landing site, as it is currently only available on the get-started/sign-up page [#6487](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6487).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."
