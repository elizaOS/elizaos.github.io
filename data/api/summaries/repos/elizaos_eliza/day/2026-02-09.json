  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Feb 9, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday saw significant progress in core infrastructure and plugin integrations, with several key issues closed related to user session management, memory persistence, and OAuth integrations. New issues were opened concerning a URL processing bug, Renovate configuration, and a UI enhancement.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new features, bug fixes, refactoring, documentation enhancements, tests, or other work were completed today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Core Infrastructure & User Management\nSeveral critical infrastructure issues were closed, enhancing user session isolation and memory persistence. This includes ensuring each user interaction creates an isolated agent instance and that conversation history and user preferences are remembered across sessions.\n- [#6409](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6409)\n- [#6411](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6411)\n- [#6434](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6434)\n- [#6462](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6462)\n\n### Plugin Integration & Webhook Services\nProgress was made on dynamic plugin loading and the integration of a calendar plugin. Additionally, a generic webhook service for stateless messaging plugins was implemented.\n- [#6403](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6403)\n- [#6405](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6405)\n- [#6430](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6430)\n\n### OAuth Integrations\nMicrosoft OAuth integration for Outlook Calendar and Email was completed, providing an alternative to Google services.\n- [#6453](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6453)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Core Processing Bug\nA bug was reported where URLs in messages trigger duplicate LLM calls, processing them as both text and attachments, leading to two responses. An additional finding indicates two different prompts are sent for URL messages, confirming core-level duplicate processing.\n- [#6486](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6486)\n\n### Configuration & UI Enhancements\nAn error in the Renovate configuration requires immediate attention, as it will halt PRs. Separately, a UI enhancement request was made to add Discord as a messaging option on the Eliza App landing site.\n- [#6488](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6488)\n- [#6487](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6487)\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."
