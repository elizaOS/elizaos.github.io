This includes support for external JWT providers and data isolation, significantly bolstering security and multi-entity support. This feature required extensive changes across client, server, and core packages, including new authentication contexts, protected routes, and JWT verification services.\n[#6200](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6200)\n\n### Plugin Optimization and Agent Intelligence\nThe `plugin-bootstrap` package received comprehensive optimization and robustness improvements, including performance enhancements, caching, and type safety. Additionally, a new `ActionFilterService` was introduced, utilizing vector search and BM25 reranking to dynamically filter actions for the LLM, drastically reducing prompt bloat and improving relevance.\n[#6476](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6476), [#6475](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6475)\n\n### CLI Stability and Usability Improvements\nSeveral critical bug fixes were addressed in the CLI. This includes ensuring that `@elizaos` dependencies in new projects always use 'latest' to prevent installation failures, validating directory paths to avoid `ENOENT` errors, and enabling `.env` file loading for agent commands to support authentication with remote servers.\n[#6362](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6362), [#6379](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6379), [#6376](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6376)\n\n### Core Robustness and Dependency Updates\nNull checks were added to `Object.entries` calls in settings utilities within the `@elizaos/core` package to prevent runtime errors. The `plugin-bootstrap` also received a null check for `runtime.providers`. Furthermore, various dependencies were bumped across `cargo` and `npm_and_yarn` groups, ensuring the project stays up-to-date with the latest libraries.\n[#6473](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6473), [#6471](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6471), [#6479](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6479), [#6478](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6478)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#6485](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6485) feat: next generation multi-language Eliza with Rust, Python and TypeScript support\n- [#6484](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6484) feat(auth): implement JWT authentication and user management\n- [#6483](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6483) docs: add environment variables documentation\n- [#6482](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6482) fix(cli): validate directory path in ensureDir to prevent ENOENT error\n- [#6480](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6480) fix(cli): always use 'latest' for @elizaos deps in created projects\n- [#6481](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6481) fix(cli): load .env files in agent commands for authentication\n- [#6477](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6477) fix: fix bootstrap cache memory leak\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### CLI Agent Command Authentication\nThe issue where `elizaos agent` commands failed when connecting to a remote server with `ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN` set has been resolved. This fix ensures that `.env` files are correctly loaded for agent commands, allowing proper authentication.\n[#5707](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5707)\n\n### Environment Variable Documentation\nComprehensive documentation for server environment variables, including `ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN`, has been added. This addresses the need for clear guidance on securing the ElizaOS server.\n[#5716](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5716)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."
