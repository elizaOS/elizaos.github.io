  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Feb 8, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant advancements in authentication, plugin optimization, and agent intelligence, alongside crucial CLI bug fixes and documentation improvements.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Authentication and User Management\nA major feature implemented today is the comprehensive JWT authentication and user management system. This includes support for external JWT providers and data isolation, significantly bolstering security and multi-entity support for ElizaOS. This feature required extensive changes across client, server, and core packages, including new database schemas and testing infrastructure. ([#6200](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6200))\n\n### Plugin Optimization and Agent Intelligence\nThe `plugin-bootstrap` package received comprehensive optimization and robustness improvements, including performance enhancements, caching, and type safety. Additionally, a new `ActionFilterService` was introduced, utilizing vector search and BM25 reranking to dynamically filter relevant actions for the LLM, drastically reducing prompt bloat from over 200 actions to around 15. ([#6476](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6476), [#6475](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6475))\n\n### CLI Stability and Usability Improvements\nSeveral critical bug fixes were addressed in the CLI. This includes ensuring that `@elizaos` dependencies in new projects always use 'latest' to prevent installation failures, validating directory paths to avoid `ENOENT` errors, and enabling agent commands to load `.env` files for proper authentication with remote servers. ([#6362](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6362), [#6379](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6379), [#6376](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6376))\n\n### Core Stability and Dependency Updates\nNull checks were added to `Object.entries` calls in settings utilities within the `@elizaos/core` package to prevent runtime errors. The `plugin-bootstrap` also received a null check for `runtime.providers` to prevent `TypeError`. Furthermore, various dependencies across `cargo` and `npm_and_yarn` groups were bumped, ensuring the project stays up-to-date with the latest libraries. ([#6473](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6473), [#6471](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6471), [#6479](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6479), [#6478](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6478))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#6485](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6485) feat: next generation multi-language Eliza with Rust, Python and TypeScript support\n- [#6484](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6484) feat(auth): implement JWT authentication and user management\n- [#6483](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6483) docs: add environment variables documentation\n- [#6482](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6482) fix(cli): validate directory path in ensureDir to prevent ENOENT error\n- [#6480](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6480) fix(cli): always use 'latest' for @elizaos deps in created projects\n- [#6481](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6481) fix(cli): load .env files in agent commands for authentication\n- [#6477](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6477) fix: fix bootstrap cache memory leak\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### CLI Authentication and Configuration Issues Resolved\nThe issue where `elizaos agent` commands failed when connecting to a remote server with `ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN` set has been resolved. This ensures smoother interaction with authenticated remote ElizaOS instances. ([#5707](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5707))\n\n### Improved Environment Variable Documentation\nComprehensive documentation for server environment variables, including `ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN`, has been added. This addresses the need for clearer guidance on configuring ElizaOS environments. ([#5716](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5716))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."
