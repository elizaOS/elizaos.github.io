The project successfully integrated a suite of major plugins—including WhatsApp, Gmail, and N8N—while simultaneously advancing its decentralization mission through new on-chain Solana identity protocols. Development focused heavily on stabilizing the core framework, resolving long-standing dependency bottlenecks via Renovate, and initiating a significant database refactor. With the first beta release targeting 100 Google OAuth users, the team is now pivoting toward fine-tuning Eliza’s personality and automated user profiling to ensure a high-impact debut.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Core Infrastructure & Refactoring\nThe team focused on the long-term maintainability of the framework with significant backend updates.\n*   **Database & Dependency Management:** A major database refactor was initiated ([#6509](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6509)) to improve system architecture. Simultaneously, the team resolved critical configuration issues with Renovate ([#6488](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6488)), enabling automated dependency updates across the `npm`, `yarn`, and `cargo` groups ([#6506](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6506), [#6507](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6507), [#6512](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6512)).\n*   **Model Support:** Added support for Opus 4.5 ([#6368](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6368)) and implemented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning streaming ([#6294](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6294)) to enhance agent transparency and performance.\n\n### Identity & Decentralization\nIn line with the core philosophy of distributed intelligence, new methods for agent identity were introduced.\n*   **On-chain Identity:** A new feature PR added the SAID Protocol for on-chain Solana identity, providing agents with verifiable cryptographic signatures ([#6510](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6510)).\n*   **Agent Discovery:** A proposal was submitted to integrate MoltBridge, which would allow for trust-verified agent discovery and \"warm introductions\" between AI agents via a broker-mediated system ([#6501](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6501)).\n\n### Plugin & Integration Expansion\nA substantial number of integrations were finalized this week, broadening the ElizaOS ecosystem:\n*   **Communication & Productivity:** Completed integrations for WhatsApp ([#6401](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6401)), Gmail/Email ([#6404](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6404)), and the N8N Workflow Engine ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429)).\n*   **Web3 & Finance:** Finalized Crypto/DeFi plugins ([#6407](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6407)) and a Privy plugin for secure authentication ([#6438](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6438)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n### Closed Issues\nThe middle of the week saw an aggressive push to clear the backlog, resolving dozens of functional and UX blockers:\n*   **Agent Capabilities:** Resolved issues regarding multi-user/room awareness ([#6416](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6416)), contact lookup ([#6417](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6417)), and cross-agent messaging ([#6418](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6418)).\n*   **UX & Bug Fixes:** Fixed dashboard redirect bugs ([#6382](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6382), [#6392](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6392)), removed the 500-character prompt limit ([#6381](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6381)), and fixed image stripping in cloud chat LLM requests ([#6494](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6494)).\n*   **Security & Compliance:** Completed a security audit for Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation ([#6472](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6472)) and recorded Google OAuth verification demos ([#6452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6452)).\n\n### New & Active Issues\nNew issues are heavily focused on the **Beta Launch (Feb 18)** and user onboarding:\n*   **Beta Readiness:** Tracking baseline product metrics ([#6504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6504)) and managing the initial rollout to 100 users ([#6505](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6505)).\n*   **User Experience:** A new proposal aims to build a \"Profile Plugin\" that automatically generates a user profile from connected accounts (X, LinkedIn, Google) to provide immediate value upon sign-up ([#6502](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6502)).\n*   **Personality Tuning:** There is an active effort to refine Eliza’s conversational tone to be more direct and witty ([#6503](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6503)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe project is currently in a high-output phase, characterized by rapid issue resolution and strategic planning. Collaboration is evident in the cross-functional nature of the work—bridging core engineering (database refactors), security (MCP audits), and marketing (AI Agency Takeover Campaign [#6439](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6439)). The focus on \"warm introductions\" and agent discovery via MoltBridge suggests a growing interest in the interoperability between different agents within the community. Additionally, the tracking of sign-ups for major tech entities like Microsoft and Google X ([#6511](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6511)) indicates the project is gaining traction with institutional stakeholders."
