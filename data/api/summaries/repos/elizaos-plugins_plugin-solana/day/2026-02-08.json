  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Daily Update (Feb 8, 2026)\n\n## OVERVIEW\nToday's development focused on enhancing Solana plugin functionality with cloud proxy routing for Birdeye and Helius, significant refactoring of the transaction system, and comprehensive documentation updates. A new CA lookup provider was also introduced.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced API Routing and Proxy Support\nCloud proxy routing has been implemented for Birdeye and Helius, allowing users without direct API keys to leverage Eliza Cloud as a proxy. This establishes a priority chain for API key usage: direct key > Eliza Cloud proxy > public endpoint. ([#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/26))\n\n### Core System Refactoring and Token Improvements\nThe transaction system has undergone a significant refactor, alongside improvements to Token-2022 metadata parsing. This work also includes the registration of Solana networks with INTEL_CHAIN and the introduction of exchange-driven swap execution. ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/24))\n\n### Comprehensive Documentation and New Provider\nThe README has been updated with extensive documentation covering installation, environment variables, usage examples, feature descriptions, and development instructions. Additionally, a new Solana CA lookup provider has been introduced to fetch on-chain token details, which is registered when `spartan-intel` is not loaded. ([#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/11), [#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/23))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."
