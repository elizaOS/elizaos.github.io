  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Weekly Report (Feb 8 - 14, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, development on the `plugin-twitter` repository focused on hardening core infrastructure and expanding the agent's interaction capabilities. The primary achievement was a comprehensive stability update that resolved a critical authentication loop, which previously hindered autonomous reliability. Additionally, the plugin's utility was expanded through the implementation of media upload support and refined mention handling, ensuring more seamless and expressive engagement within the Twitter ecosystem.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Core Stability & Authentication\nThe team prioritized the reliability of the agent's connection to the platform. A major update addressed a critical failure mode where the plugin would enter an infinite authentication retry loop. This fix ensures that the agent can maintain a persistent presence without manual intervention or resource exhaustion.\n*   **Authentication Loop Resolution:** Fixed logic errors in the retry mechanism to improve robust connectivity ([#48](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/48)).\n\n### Interaction & Media Enhancements\nSignificant work was completed to move the plugin beyond text-only interactions, aligning with the goal of creating more adaptable and capable AI agents.\n*   **Media Upload Functionality:** Implemented the ability for agents to upload and attach media to tweets, broadening the scope of content generation ([#48](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/48)).\n*   **Mention Reply Logic:** Refined how the plugin processes and responds to mentions, improving the accuracy of social interactions across `src/interactions.ts` and `src/client/tweets.ts` ([#48](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/48)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe week was characterized by a concentrated effort on internal code quality rather than high-volume issue reporting.\n*   **Closed Issues:** While no standalone issues were closed via the issue tracker, the technical debt associated with authentication stability and interaction bugs was resolved through direct pull request contributions.\n*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported during this period, and there were no active discussions exceeding three comments, suggesting a period of focused implementation by the core contributors.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was centered around a large-scale technical update ([#48](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/48)) that touched multiple core files, including the base client, post services, and utility functions. This indicates a coordinated effort to refactor and improve the plugin's foundation. While the middle of the week saw a lull in activity, the subsequent push resulted in significant functional gains for the framework's Twitter integration."
