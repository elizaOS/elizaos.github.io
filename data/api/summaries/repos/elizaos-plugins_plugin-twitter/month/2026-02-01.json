  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Monthly Report (February 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nIn February 2026, development for the `plugin-twitter` repository focused on hardening core interaction capabilities and stabilizing the authentication layer. The primary achievement was the resolution of a critical authentication loop that previously hindered agent autonomy. Additionally, the plugin's utility was expanded through the successful implementation of media upload support and refined mention handling, ensuring more reliable and expressive communication for AI agents within the Twitter ecosystem.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Core Stability & Authentication\nThe development team prioritized the reliability of the agent's connection to the platform. A major update addressed a critical failure point where the plugin would enter an infinite retry loop during authentication failures. This fix ensures that agents can recover gracefully from connection issues without exhausting resources or triggering platform rate limits [#48](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/48).\n\n### Interaction & Media Enhancements\nTo move closer to the goal of a fully expressive AI agent framework, significant work was completed to improve how agents interact with users and content:\n*   **Media Support:** Implemented the foundational logic for media uploads, allowing agents to share images or video content rather than being restricted to text-only posts [#48](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/48).\n*   **Mention Logic:** Fixed issues surrounding mention replies to ensure agents correctly identify and respond to direct interactions, improving the accuracy of conversational flows [#48](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/48).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe month was characterized by targeted bug resolution rather than high-volume issue reporting. \n\n*   **Closed Issues:** While no standalone issues were closed via the GitHub issue tracker, the comprehensive updates in PR [#48](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/48) effectively resolved several critical bugs identified during internal testing phases, specifically regarding authentication and reply mechanisms.\n*   **New & Active Issues:** There were no new issues reported or significant ongoing discussions in the latter half of the month, suggesting a period of stability following the mid-month technical updates.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was concentrated around a significant consolidated update. The technical developments indicate a focused effort by maintainers to address multiple high-priority blockers simultaneously. While the repository saw periods of inactivity, the contributions made on February 13th represent a substantial leap in the plugin's production readiness, reflecting the project's commitment to modularity and robust Web2 integration."
