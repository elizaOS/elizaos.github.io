  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-trust Monthly Report (February 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nIn February 2026, development for the `plugin-trust` repository focused on refining the core evaluation logic and addressing critical data handling bugs within the ElizaOS ecosystem. The primary theme of the month was improving the robustness of trust assessments, specifically ensuring the plugin can accurately process plain-text requests. Additionally, the team began investigating significant issues regarding multi-modal data integrity, specifically where image content was being stripped during LLM interactions.\n\n## 🛠️️ Key Developments\n\n### Trust Evaluation Refinement\nEfforts this month were directed toward ensuring the plugin handles diverse input formats reliably.\n*   **Plain-Text Processing:** A key fix was introduced to improve how the plugin manages trust evaluation requests submitted as plain text. This ensures that the trust logic is triggered correctly even when structured data is not provided. ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-trust/pull/1))\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n### New & Active Issues\nThe project is currently tracking a high-priority issue regarding data loss in cloud-based chat environments.\n*   **Multi-modal Data Integrity:** Issue [#6494](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-trust/issues/6494) highlights a bug where image content is stripped from LLM requests within the `/api/v1/chat/completions` endpoint and the `convertToUIMessages` function. This is a significant blocker for features requiring visual context, and a developer has been assigned to resolve the data stripping in the UI message conversion pipeline.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was characterized by targeted troubleshooting of the plugin's integration with the broader ElizaOS cloud infrastructure. The activity surrounding the image-stripping issue indicates active monitoring of the framework's API performance, with maintainers quickly assigning resources to address regressions in multi-modal support. Development remains focused on the modularity of the trust plugin, ensuring it remains compatible with the evolving requirements of the ElizaOS agent framework."
