  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-trust Weekly Report (Feb 8 - 14, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, development for the `plugin-trust` repository focused on refining the core trust evaluation logic and addressing critical data handling bugs within the ElizaOS ecosystem. The primary focus was on ensuring the plugin correctly processes plain-text evaluation requests while investigating issues related to multi-modal data loss in cloud chat environments. These efforts align with our mission of building a robust, adaptable framework for autonomous agent reasoning.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Trust Evaluation Refinement\nWork began on improving how the plugin interprets and processes incoming data for trust scoring.\n*   **Plain-Text Handling:** A significant update was initiated to fix the handling of plain-text trust evaluation requests. This ensures that the plugin can reliably process non-structured text inputs to generate trust metrics, improving the modularity of the evaluation engine. [#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-trust/pull/1)\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n### Active Issues\nThe team is currently investigating a high-priority issue regarding data integrity during LLM interactions.\n*   **Multi-modal Data Loss:** Issue [#6494](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-trust/issues/6494) identifies a bug where image content is being stripped from LLM requests in cloud chat. This occurs specifically within the `/api/v1/chat/completions` endpoint and the `convertToUIMessages` function. A developer has been assigned to this task, as resolving this is critical for agents that rely on visual context for trust and safety evaluations.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nActivity this week centered on the initial triage of integration bugs and the submission of the first major pull request for the plugin's evaluation logic. The assignment of a developer to the image-stripping issue indicates active maintenance and a commitment to resolving blockers that affect the broader ElizaOS cloud infrastructure. Collaboration is currently focused on ensuring the plugin's compatibility with the core framework's API transformations."
