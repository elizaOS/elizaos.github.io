  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw a significant feature addition to the registry generation script, improving its robustness by detecting version and core dependency mismatches and correctly setting support flags. Additionally, a key issue regarding the addition of JSON API endpoints for summaries was closed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Registry Generation Logic\n*   The registry generation script was improved to detect and warn about package version versus core dependency mismatches, ensuring greater consistency and reliability.\n*   The script now accurately sets `supports` flags based on actual core dependencies rather than package versions, leading to more precise compatibility information. ([#244](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/244))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Implementation of JSON API Endpoints for Summaries\n*   The issue concerning the extension of the static JSON API to include summary endpoints alongside existing leaderboard endpoints has been closed. This enhancement allows for more comprehensive data access. ([#185](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/185))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### JSON API Endpoints for Summaries ([#185](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/185))\nThe discussion on this issue focused on refining the approach for adding JSON API endpoints. The refined plan, based on data engineering feedback, decided to piggyback JSON generation alongside markdown during the `summarize` command, rather than a separate export step. The team agreed that a full export is acceptable given the current data volume. The enhanced response shape for the API was defined, including fields like `version`, `type`, `interval`, `date`, `generatedAt`, `sourceLastUpdated`, `contentFormat`, `contentHash`, `entity`, and `content`. Specific dated and latest pointer endpoints were outlined for overall, repository, and contributor summaries, along with index files. Implementation changes involve modifying existing summary generation scripts to write JSON alongside markdown and adding shared utilities for content hashing, building summary response objects, and updating latest/index pointers. The rationale for this approach emphasizes synchronization between JSON artifacts, markdown, and the database, efficient client-side caching, and a clear upgrade path for incremental exports. The issue was subsequently merged."
