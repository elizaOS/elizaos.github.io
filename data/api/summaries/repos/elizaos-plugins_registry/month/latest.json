  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (February 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nFebruary 2026 was a month of rapid expansion for the ElizaOS plugin registry, characterized by a significant influx of new integrations that bridge AI agents with complex financial and data ecosystems. The primary theme was the enhancement of agent autonomy through secure transaction guardrails and specialized Web3 services, including perpetual trading and decentralized marketplaces. While the registry grew in functional scope, the community also began addressing foundational challenges regarding agent logic optimization and the economic transparency of LLM usage.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Transaction Security & Guardrails\nA major focus this month was the introduction of safety mechanisms for agent-led transactions.\n*   **Proofgate Integration:** The `@proofgate/eliza-plugin` was introduced to provide transaction validation guardrails, ensuring agents operate within secure and reliable parameters ([#254](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/254), [#257](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/257)).\n\n### Financial Services & Web3 Payments\nThe registry saw a diverse set of plugins aimed at enabling sophisticated financial operations across multiple chains.\n*   **Payments & Escrow:** New additions include `plugin-coinrailz` for crypto micropayments ([#245](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/245)), `@kamiyo/eliza` for Solana-based escrow and dispute resolution ([#246](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/246)), and AsterPay for x402 payments with EUR off-ramps ([#251](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/251)).\n*   **Trading & Marketplaces:** The ecosystem expanded into decentralized commerce with `plugin-moltbazaar`, an AI Agent Job Marketplace on Base ([#255](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/255)). Trading capabilities were bolstered by the Arthur DEX plugin for Orderly Network perpetuals ([#256](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/256)) and `@erdgecrawl/plugin-base-signals` for L2 smart money tracking ([#253](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/253)).\n\n### Data Integration & Model Routing\nNew plugins were added to provide agents with real-time information and diverse model access.\n*   **Live Data:** The `@elizaos/plugin-sportradar` brings live sports data into the framework ([#250](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/250)).\n*   **Model Access:** The `@zane-archer/plugin-aimo-router` was integrated to allow agents to access models from the AiMo Network ([#247](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/247)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n### New & Active Issues\n*   **Cost Transparency:** Discussion continued on the \"Cost Evaluator for LLM Usage\" ([#5759](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5759)). This proposal aims to implement a system to estimate the dollar cost of LLM steps based on token counts, a feature deemed essential for the economic sustainability of autonomous agents.\n*   **Prompt Engineering vs. Logic:** A significant discussion emerged regarding Eliza's character files and prompt engineering ([#6447](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6447)). Contributors are debating the \"Biological Trap\" of relying on prose-based prompts, suggesting a shift toward agents syncing via logic and structured blueprints (referencing MAE-1.0) to optimize performance.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe month showed a high level of external contribution, evidenced by the variety of third-party namespaces (e.g., `@proofgate`, `@kamiyo`, `@zane-archer`) entering the registry. Collaboration is moving beyond simple plugin submissions into deeper architectural debates, as seen in the discussions between contributors like Renator13 and ralyodio regarding the fundamental ways agents process logic and manage operational costs. This indicates a maturing community that is thinking critically about the long-term scalability of the ElizaOS framework."
