  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Feb 15 - 21, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, the ElizaOS registry focused on expanding its ecosystem through the addition of several new plugins while simultaneously addressing critical infrastructure bottlenecks. The project saw a surge in Web3-focused integrations, particularly within the Solana ecosystem, reinforcing the framework's modularity across decentralized protocols. However, progress was briefly hampered by CI/CD workflow failures that impacted the automated review process for external contributors, leading to targeted fixes for the registry's automation pipeline.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Plugin Registry Expansion\nThe registry continues to grow as a central hub for agent capabilities, with several new plugins proposed to enhance agent utility in Web3 and data exchange:\n*   **Web3 & Identity:** Introduction of `@elizaos/plugin-said` ([#264](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/264)), which integrates the SAID Protocol for on-chain Solana identity.\n*   **Exchange & Data Integrations:** Multiple PRs were submitted for exchange-related functionalities, including `@elizaos/plugin-buzz-bd` ([#261](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/261)) and the SolCex Exchange BD plugin via `@buzzbd/plugin-solcex-bd` ([#262](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/262), [#263](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/263)).\n*   **Community Contributions:** Addition of the `plugin-kamiyo-trust` ([#258](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/258)) to the registry.\n\n### CI/CD & Infrastructure Improvements\nMaintainers worked to resolve technical debt and permission issues within the automated testing suite to ensure a smoother contribution pipeline:\n*   **Workflow Permissions:** Addressed a critical failure in the `claude-review` workflow caused by missing `id-token: write` permissions ([#259](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/259)).\n*   **Fork PR Support:** Implemented a fix in [#260](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/260) to resolve issues specifically affecting the Claude review process on pull requests originating from forked repositories, ensuring external contributors receive automated feedback.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n### New & Active Issues\n*   **Workflow Blockers:** The primary concern this week was Issue [#259](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/259), which identified that the automated review system was blocking valid registry PRs. This was identified as a high-priority infrastructure task as it directly impacted the speed of merging new plugin contributions.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe activity this week highlights a strong push from the community to integrate more diverse blockchain and exchange tools into the ElizaOS framework. The rapid identification and subsequent PRs to fix the `claude-review` workflow demonstrate an active maintenance cycle focused on reducing friction for outside contributors. The presence of multiple PRs for the same plugins (e.g., SolCex) suggests active iteration and refinement of new submissions before they are finalized in the registry."
