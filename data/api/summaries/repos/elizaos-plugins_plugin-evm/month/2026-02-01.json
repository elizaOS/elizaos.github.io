  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm Monthly Report (February 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nIn February 2026, development on the EVM plugin focused on hardening the core infrastructure to ensure high availability and broader chain compatibility. The primary achievements included the implementation of a sophisticated multi-provider RPC abstraction layer and a total overhaul of the EVMService. These updates transition the plugin toward a more resilient, production-ready state by introducing automatic provider fallbacks and integrating a comprehensive chain registry, directly supporting ElizaOS's mission of creating adaptable and autonomous AI agents.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Infrastructure & RPC Resilience\nTo address the need for reliable blockchain connectivity, a new multi-provider RPC abstraction was introduced. This system allows agents to interface with multiple major infrastructure providers, ensuring that network requests remain stable even during individual provider outages.\n*   **Multi-Provider Support:** Integrated support for Alchemy, Infura, Ankr, and the Eliza Cloud proxy.\n*   **Reliability Features:** Implemented automatic fallback mechanisms to switch providers dynamically based on availability and performance ([#25](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/25)).\n\n### EVMService Architecture Overhaul\nThe core `EVMService` underwent a significant refactor to expand its capabilities and improve how agents manage assets and interact with smart contracts.\n*   **Chain Registry Integration:** Integrated with the Spartan-Intel chain registry to standardize chain data and interactions ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/24)).\n*   **Wallet & Transaction Management:** Introduced robust validation and signing capabilities, alongside enhanced wallet and key operations.\n*   **Asset Management:** Added comprehensive features for balance and portfolio management, transfer functionalities, and a DEX registry for decentralized exchange interactions.\n*   **Optimization:** Implemented multicall batching to reduce RPC overhead and optimized provider selection logic ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/24)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe month was characterized by heavy architectural lifting through direct pull requests rather than a high volume of community-reported issues.\n*   **Closed Issues:** No specific issues were closed via the standard issue tracker this month, as the focus remained on the primary service overhauls.\n*   **New & Active Issues:** There were no new issues reported or active discussions with high engagement (3+ comments) during this period, suggesting a period of focused internal development on core features.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was centered on foundational PRs that set the stage for future plugin extensibility. The work on the RPC abstraction and the EVMService overhaul indicates a high level of coordination between maintainers to align the plugin with the broader ElizaOS modular architecture. While the reports show a concentrated burst of activity on specific technical milestones, the lack of new issues suggests the current contributor focus is on stabilizing the core API before expanding to wider community testing."
