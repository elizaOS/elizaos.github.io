  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm Daily Update (Feb 8, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant enhancements to the EVM plugin, introducing multi-provider RPC support and integrating Spartan-Intel for expanded EVM service capabilities.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced RPC Provider Flexibility\nA new feature was added to support multi-provider RPC abstraction, including Alchemy, Infura, Ankr, and Eliza Cloud. This allows for automatic fallback and selection of preferred providers, significantly improving reliability and coverage across various chains. ([#25](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/25))\n\n### Spartan-Intel Integration and EVM Service Overhaul\nThe EVMService was overhauled to integrate with the Spartan-Intel chain registry. This integration introduces new functionalities such as wallet/key operations, validation/signing, balance/portfolio management, transfers, DEX registry, and multicall batching, alongside provider optimizations. ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/24))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."
