  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw significant progress in Discord bot functionality, including the implementation of a tiered permission system for bot invite URLs and enhanced slash command permissions.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Discord Bot Permissions\n*   A new tiered permission system for Discord bot invite URLs was added, featuring a 3x2 matrix of role levels (Basic, Moderator, Admin) and voice options (With Voice, Without Voice). This involved creating `src/permissions.ts` for centralized permission definitions and enhancing the banner. ([#33](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/33))\n*   Hybrid slash-command permissions were implemented, incorporating Discord permissions, channel-whitelist bypass, and custom validators. This also included a safer command registration pipeline and fixes for DM channel handling. ([#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/29))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n### JSON API Endpoints for Summaries\n*   Issue [#185](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/185) was closed after being merged. This feature extended the static JSON API to include summary endpoints alongside existing leaderboard endpoints. The discussion refined the approach to piggyback JSON generation alongside markdown during the `summarize` command, ensuring JSON artifacts are always in sync. Key design decisions included generating JSON alongside markdown, allowing full export due to manageable volume, and keeping `export-summaries` as a backfill tool. The refined approach also detailed an enhanced response shape for the API and specific endpoints for dated files, latest pointers, and index files.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### JSON API Endpoints for Summaries ([#185](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/185))\nThe issue, now closed, focused on adding JSON API endpoints for summaries. The discussion, primarily led by madjin, detailed a refined approach for implementation. Key points included:\n*   **Piggybacking JSON generation**: JSON should be generated alongside markdown during the `summarize` command, not as a separate export step.\n*   **Full export is acceptable**: The current volume of data (5-10 repos, ~200 contributors, 1 year) is small enough that a full export is efficient, negating the immediate need for incremental updates.\n*   **`export-summaries` as a backfill tool**: The `export-summaries` command should remain an optional maintenance tool for backfilling or rebuilding JSON from existing database data.\n*   **Enhanced Response Shape**: A detailed `SummaryAPIResponse` interface was proposed, including fields like `version`, `type`, `interval`, `date`, `generatedAt`, `sourceLastUpdated`, `contentFormat`, `contentHash`, `entity`, and `content`.\n*   **Endpoint Structure**: Specific endpoints were outlined for dated files (e.g., `/data/api/summaries/overall/{interval}/{date}.json`), latest pointers (e.g., `/data/api/summaries/overall/{interval}/latest.json`), and index files (e.g., `/data/api/summaries/overall/{interval}/index.json`).\n*   **Implementation Changes**: The plan involved modifying existing `generateOverallSummary.ts` (and similar files) to write JSON alongside markdown and adding `apiHelpers.ts` for shared utilities like `sha256`, `buildSummaryResponse`, `writeLatestPointer`, and `updateIndex`.\n*   **DRY Principles**: madjin further emphasized keeping the code DRY by reusing existing utilities like `fsHelpers.ts` and `date-utils.ts`, and avoiding new files where existing ones could be extended. Specifically, `sha256()`, `getContributorSummaryFilePath()`, `getAPIFilePath()`, `writeLatestPointer()`, `updateIndex()`, and new type definitions were identified as necessary additions.\nThe issue was ultimately merged."
