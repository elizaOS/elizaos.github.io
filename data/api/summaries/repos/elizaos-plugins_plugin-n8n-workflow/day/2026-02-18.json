This ensures that default property values are correctly applied before visibility is determined, preventing issues when structural fields are omitted by the LLM.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Workflow Property Visibility Fix\nA bug was addressed where property defaults were not applied before visibility checks, leading to incorrect visibility determinations when structural fields were omitted. This fix ensures that `isPropertyVisible` correctly considers default values for fields like `resource`, `operation`, and `language`, resolving issues with dependent fields.
