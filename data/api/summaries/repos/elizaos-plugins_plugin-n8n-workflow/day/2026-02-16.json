  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow Daily Update (Feb 16, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing the `plugin-n8n-workflow` by adding REST API routes for comprehensive workflow management, enabling direct frontend interaction without the NLP pipeline.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Workflow Management API\n- Implemented new REST API routes to facilitate CRUD operations for workflows, node catalog browsing, validation, and execution monitoring, bypassing the agent NLP pipeline. This dual approach allows for direct frontend access to workflow functionalities. ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16))\n- Introduced new files in `src/routes` to handle specific API endpoints for executions, nodes, validation, and workflows. ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16))\n\n### Testing and Infrastructure Updates\n- Added extensive unit tests for the new API routes, covering executions, nodes, validation, and workflows to ensure functionality and reliability. ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16))\n- Updated `__tests__/helpers` with `mockService.ts` and `e2eRuntime.ts` to support testing of the new API routes. ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16))\n- Modified `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to potentially integrate new testing procedures for the added routes. ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- None\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- None\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n- None\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n- None"
