  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow Weekly Report (Feb 15 - 21, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, development on the `plugin-n8n-workflow` focused on expanding the plugin's accessibility and improving the reliability of LLM-generated node configurations. The primary achievement was the introduction of a comprehensive REST API, which allows for direct workflow management and execution monitoring outside of the standard NLP pipeline. Additionally, the team addressed a critical logic bug regarding property visibility, ensuring that workflows remain stable even when the AI omits structural fields. These updates move the project toward a more robust, hybrid architecture that supports both autonomous agent interaction and manual frontend control.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Workflow Management API & Infrastructure\nThe project underwent a significant expansion of its interface capabilities by implementing a suite of REST API routes. This allows developers and frontends to interact with n8n workflows directly, bypassing the agent's natural language processing for more deterministic control.\n*   **CRUD & Monitoring:** Implemented new routes for workflow CRUD operations, node catalog browsing, and execution monitoring ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16)).\n*   **Architecture:** Introduced dedicated services and type definitions to support these API endpoints, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16)).\n*   **Testing:** Established a rigorous testing suite for the new infrastructure, including unit tests for validation and execution routes, as well as an end-to-end test for the workflow management process ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16)).\n\n### Workflow Stability & LLM Integration\nA critical fix was deployed to improve how the plugin handles input from Large Language Models, specifically regarding node property evaluation.\n*   **Property Visibility Fix:** Resolved an issue where property defaults were not applied before visibility checks. This ensures that essential fields (like `resource` or `operation`) are correctly evaluated even if the LLM omits them, preventing workflow failures during automated node configuration ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/18)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe repository maintained a focused development cycle this week with no new external issues reported.\n*   **Closed Issues:** While no standalone issues were closed, the primary technical hurdles regarding API implementation and property visibility were resolved through direct pull request contributions ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16), [#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/18)).\n*   **New & Active Issues:** There are currently no active issues with high engagement (3+ comments), suggesting that the current development focus is being handled efficiently through the PR process.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was characterized by high-impact, foundational contributions. The development of the REST API ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16)) represents a significant collaborative effort to align the plugin with broader ElizaOS modularity standards. The quick identification and resolution of the property visibility bug ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/18)) demonstrate a proactive approach to maintaining the \"Autonomy & Adaptability\" core philosophy, ensuring the agent can reason effectively even with incomplete data."
