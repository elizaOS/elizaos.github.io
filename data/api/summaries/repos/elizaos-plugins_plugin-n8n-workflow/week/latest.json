  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow Weekly Report (Feb 8 - 14, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week focused on advancing the plugin's maturity from a creation-only tool to a comprehensive workflow management suite. The primary achievement was the introduction of workflow modification capabilities, allowing agents to iterate on existing deployments. This was bolstered by the implementation of rigorous output schema validation to ensure data integrity across n8n nodes. These advancements culminated in the release of version 1.1.0, marking a significant milestone in the plugin's stability and feature set.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Workflow Lifecycle & Management\nThe plugin transitioned beyond simple workflow generation to support full lifecycle management. Developers and agents can now load previously deployed workflows, modify them, and redeploy changes using the existing creation actions. This creates a feedback loop for iterative workflow improvement ([#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/14)).\n\n### Validation & Data Integrity\nTo improve the reliability of generated workflows, new validation logic was introduced.\n*   **Schema Validation:** Implemented checks to ensure that `$json.field` expressions correctly reference existing fields within the workflow context.\n*   **Parameter Correction:** Refined how parameters are handled to reduce errors during the workflow execution phase ([#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/14)).\n\n### Versioning and Releases\nThe project successfully moved from version 1.0.12 to 1.1.0. This version bump serves as the baseline for the new modification features, output schemas, and enhanced validation logic ([#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/15)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe reporting period showed a focus on proactive development rather than reactive bug fixing.\n*   **Closed Issues:** No external issues were closed this week, as the focus remained on the primary feature pull requests.\n*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported during this timeframe, suggesting a stable release for the 1.1.0 milestone.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nActivity this week was driven by core development aimed at expanding the plugin's technical capabilities. The transition to version 1.1.0 indicates a structured approach to the project's roadmap, prioritizing modularity and the ability for AI agents to reason about and adapt existing automation structures. Collaboration centered on the integration of schema validation, ensuring that the plugin remains a robust bridge between ElizaOS agents and n8n's automation ecosystem."
