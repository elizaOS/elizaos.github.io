  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Feb 15 - 21, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week was characterized by a period of maintenance and stability for the ElizaOS documentation and website repository. Activity focused primarily on routine dependency management to ensure the project remains secure and up-to-date. While no major feature releases or architectural shifts were recorded during this window, the groundwork for consistent environment health was maintained through automated or semi-automated updates.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Dependency Management & Maintenance\nThe primary technical activity this week involved keeping the project's underlying software stack current.\n*   **Version Synchronization:** A new pull request, [#242](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/242), was initiated to update minor and patch versions of dependencies across a specific directory. This type of maintenance is critical for the ElizaOS ecosystem to prevent technical debt and ensure compatibility with the latest security patches and performance improvements in the broader Web2/Web3 tooling landscape.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe repository saw a quiet week regarding issue tracking and bug reporting.\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no active discussions on existing issues exceeding the three-comment threshold. This suggests a stable state for the current documentation site, with no immediate blockers or critical bugs identified by the community during this timeframe.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was centered on internal maintenance tasks. The opening of PR [#242](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/242) indicates ongoing attention to the project's infrastructure. While there were no high-velocity discussions or controversial threads, the steady pace of dependency updates reflects a commitment to the \"Modularity & Composability\" philosophy by ensuring the framework's entry point—its documentation and web presence—remains technically sound."
