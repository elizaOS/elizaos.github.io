  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Monthly Report (February 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nDuring February 2026, development activity focused on maintaining the project's infrastructure and expanding the ecosystem's integration capabilities. Key efforts included routine dependency management to ensure site security and the integration of new plugin tracking for n8n workflows. Additionally, the community began a high-level architectural dialogue regarding the evolution of character files and prompt engineering, moving toward more logic-based agent synchronization.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Infrastructure & Dependency Management\nTo maintain the stability and security of the documentation site, the project performed routine maintenance on its core framework.\n*   **Next.js Update:** The `next` dependency was bumped from version 16.1.5 to 16.1.6 to incorporate minor fixes and patches ([#240](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/240)).\n\n### Ecosystem Expansion\nThe project continues to broaden its scope by integrating more modular components into its tracking pipeline.\n*   **Plugin Integration:** Support for `elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow` was added to the pipeline configuration within `config/example.json`. This expansion allows the framework to better track and showcase n8n workflow capabilities within the ElizaOS ecosystem ([#241](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/241)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n### New & Active Issues\n*   **Character File Optimization:** A significant discussion was initiated regarding the current state of Eliza's character files and prompt engineering ([#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6447)). \n*   **The \"Biological Trap\":** Community members are debating the overhead of prose-based prompt engineering. There is an active proposal to shift toward agents that sync via structured logic rather than natural language prose, referencing the MAE-1.0 framework and BotNode.io optimization blueprints as potential paths forward.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe month's activity reflects a mix of automated maintenance and deep technical philosophy. While pull requests were focused on technical housekeeping and configuration, the issue tracker saw high-quality engagement from contributors like Renator13. The dialogue suggests a community that is not only focused on building but also on refining the underlying theory of AI agent communication, specifically pushing for decentralization and more efficient \"logic-over-prose\" architectures."
