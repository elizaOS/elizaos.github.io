  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Monthly Report (February 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nIn February 2026, development for the `plugin-mcp` repository focused heavily on hardening the architecture for multi-tenant environments. The primary theme of the month was the transition from global configurations to secure, per-user Model Context Protocol (MCP) connections. By implementing dynamic API key injection and eliminating shared-state mutations, the project has significantly improved its security posture and isolation capabilities, ensuring that AI agents can safely handle individual user contexts within a shared framework.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Multi-Tenant Security & Connection Isolation\nThe core technical focus this month was ensuring that MCP connections are isolated between different users to prevent data leakage and configuration conflicts.\n*   **Per-User MCP Connections:** Introduced the ability to inject API keys dynamically based on individual user contexts. This involved modifying the MCP connection lifecycle and request headers to support unique origins and credentials ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/23)).\n*   **Elimination of Shared-State Mutation:** Addressed a critical architectural risk where shared-state MCP mutations could compromise multi-tenant safety. The fix ensures that state is no longer globally mutated during connection establishment ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/24)).\n\n### Connection Lifecycle Optimization\nTo support the new multi-tenant requirements without sacrificing performance, the team refined how connections are established.\n*   **Lazy HTTP Connections:** Implemented a \"lazy\" connection strategy for HTTP MCP. Following initial schema fetching, the system now utilizes `ensureConnected()` to create per-entity connections on-demand, pulling the correct API keys from the active request context ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/24)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe month was characterized by proactive architectural improvements rather than reactive bug fixing.\n*   **Closed Issues:** While no external issues were formally closed, the internal resolution of shared-state mutation risks ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/24)) addressed the most significant technical debt identified during the period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:** No new high-activity issues (more than 3 comments) were reported this month, suggesting a stable release cycle following the multi-tenancy upgrades.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was concentrated on core architectural refinements. The development cycle showed a tight feedback loop between identifying multi-tenancy risks (Feb 4-6) and implementing robust fixes (Feb 8). The focus remained on high-impact PRs ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/23), [#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/24)) that required careful consideration of request contexts and URL-origin checks, reflecting a sophisticated level of technical review regarding security and modularity."
