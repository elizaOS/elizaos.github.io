  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Weekly Report (Feb 8 - 14, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, development focused on strengthening the architectural integrity of the MCP plugin, specifically regarding multi-tenant security and connection management. The primary achievement was the elimination of shared-state mutations, ensuring that AI agents operating in multi-user environments maintain strict isolation. By transitioning to lazy connection patterns and per-entity context handling, the project has significantly improved its safety profile for enterprise and distributed deployments.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Multi-Tenant Safety & Connection Architecture\nThe core technical focus was resolving vulnerabilities related to shared-state MCP mutations. This work ensures that connections are securely isolated between different entities.\n*   **Lazy Connection Implementation:** HTTP MCP connections were refactored to be \"lazy\" following the initial schema fetch. This ensures that the `ensureConnected()` method creates unique, per-entity connections using the specific API keys provided in the request context.\n*   **State Isolation:** By eliminating shared-state mutations, the plugin prevents potential data leakage or credential cross-contamination between different tenants.\n*   **Configuration Updates:** Introduced `MCP_ENABLED_SER` to support these architectural changes ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/24)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n*   **Closed Issues:** No specific issues were closed during this period; however, the major architectural fix in [#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/24) addressed critical underlying bugs related to connection state.\n*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported or reached high-activity thresholds (3+ comments) during this timeframe, suggesting a period of focused implementation on existing architectural priorities.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was centered on core plugin security and stability. The primary activity involved deep technical refactoring of the connection logic to align with ElizaOS’s philosophy of modularity and autonomy. The focus on multi-tenant safety indicates a collaborative effort to prepare the plugin for more complex, real-world deployment scenarios where secure, distributed intelligence is paramount."
