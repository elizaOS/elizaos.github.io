  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama Monthly Report (February 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nIn February 2026, development for the `plugin-ollama` repository focused on refining the developer experience through essential documentation maintenance. The primary objective was ensuring seamless onboarding for new users by correcting installation procedures. While the volume of changes was targeted, the focus remained on maintaining the reliability and accessibility of the plugin within the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Documentation & Developer Experience\nThe month's technical activity centered on ensuring that the entry point for developers—the installation process—is accurate and functional. \n\n*   **Installation Command Correction:** A critical fix was applied to the project's documentation to resolve an error in the setup instructions. The `bun install` command was updated to reflect the correct package name and syntax, preventing potential friction for users integrating Ollama capabilities into their AI agents ([#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/pull/15)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe project maintained a stable state throughout February with minimal reported friction.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No specific issues were formally closed during this period, as the primary documentation fix was handled directly via pull request.\n*   **New & Active Issues:** There were no new issues reported or active discussions exceeding the engagement threshold, indicating a period of stability for the current plugin implementation.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was characterized by targeted maintenance. The focus on correcting the `README.md` demonstrates a commitment to the \"Open Collaboration\" pillar of the ElizaOS philosophy, ensuring that the barrier to entry for the community remains low. The activity suggests a maintenance-oriented phase where the priority is the accuracy of the existing codebase and its supporting documentation."
