  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama Weekly Report (Feb 15 - 21, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThe week of February 15–21 was a period of stability and monitoring for the Ollama plugin, with no new code changes or pull requests merged. The primary focus shifted toward community-reported stability, specifically regarding how the plugin handles embedding tasks. A significant technical hurdle was identified concerning model configuration and endpoint connectivity on Linux environments, which currently serves as the main point of investigation for the project.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThere were no new technical developments, feature additions, or pull requests submitted during this reporting period. The codebase remained stable as the team monitored existing implementations.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe week's activity centered on identifying potential regressions or configuration bottlenecks within the plugin's integration with Ollama instances.\n\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Embedding Configuration Errors:** A critical issue was raised regarding failures in the embedding process ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/issues/17)). Despite the Ollama instance running correctly on Ubuntu 24.04, users reported errors when the plugin attempted to interface with the embedding models. This issue highlights potential complexities in how `OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT` interacts with specific model definitions (`OLLAMA_SMALL_MODEL`, `OLLAMA_MEDIUM_MODEL`, etc.) and suggests a need for more robust error handling or clearer configuration documentation for Linux-based deployments.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:**\n    *   No issues were closed during this timeframe.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was primarily driven by user feedback and bug reporting. The report on issue [#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/issues/17) indicates active engagement from the community in testing the plugin within specific OS environments (Ubuntu 24.04). While there were no new contributors to the codebase this week, the detailed reporting of environment variables and model settings by the community provides the necessary data for maintainers to troubleshoot connectivity and embedding logic in future updates."
