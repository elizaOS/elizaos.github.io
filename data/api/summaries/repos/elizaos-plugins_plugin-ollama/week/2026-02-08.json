  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama Weekly Report (Feb 8 - 14, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, development for the `plugin-ollama` repository focused on refining the developer onboarding experience through critical documentation maintenance. The primary achievement involved correcting installation procedures to align with standard package management practices. While the volume of code changes was low, the focus remained on ensuring the modularity and accessibility of the ElizaOS ecosystem by providing accurate entry points for new users and contributors.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Documentation & Developer Experience\nThe core technical activity this week centered on ensuring the reliability of the plugin's installation instructions. Accurate documentation is vital for the \"Modularity & Composability\" philosophy of ElizaOS, as it allows developers to seamlessly integrate Ollama-based local LLM capabilities into their agents.\n- **Installation Command Correction:** A pull request was merged to fix an invalid `bun install` command in the `README.md`. The instruction was updated to the correct `bun add @elizaos/plugin-ollama` syntax, preventing potential setup errors for developers utilizing the Bun runtime ([#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/pull/15)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe project maintained a stable state throughout this period with no new bugs reported or complex issues opened.\n- **Closed Issues:** No specific issues were closed this week; however, the proactive fix in [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/pull/15) addressed a potential friction point before it resulted in formal issue reports.\n- **New & Active Issues:** There were no new or active issues recorded during this timeframe, indicating a period of stability for the current plugin implementation.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was characterized by maintenance-driven contributions aimed at improving the user-facing documentation. The successful merge of PR [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-ollama/pull/15) demonstrates a continued commitment to project health and the removal of barriers for the open-source community. The repository remains in a stable, ready-to-use state for contributors looking to leverage local AI models within the ElizaOS framework."
