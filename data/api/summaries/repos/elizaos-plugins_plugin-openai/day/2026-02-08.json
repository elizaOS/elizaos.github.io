This enhancement aims to significantly reduce duplicate calls and improve latency for audio and image processing.\n- Implemented content-based cache keys for `audio.ts` `handleTranscription` using slice-hashed blobs and parameters for best-effort caching.\n- Added caching mechanisms to `image.ts` for image descriptions.\n- Updated `package.json` to reflect changes related to caching.\n- This work is detailed in [#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/23).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."
