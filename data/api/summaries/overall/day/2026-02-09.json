  "content": "On February 9, 2026, the ElizaOS project made significant strides in core infrastructure and plugin integration, closing several critical issues related to user session management, memory persistence, and OAuth integrations. Concurrently, new issues emerged concerning a URL processing bug, Renovate configuration, and a UI enhancement for Discord integration.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Infrastructure & User Management\n- Implemented isolated user sessions for multi-tenant architecture, enhancing user data separation and security. [elizaos/eliza#6409](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6409)\n- Ensured Eliza remembers conversations and user preferences across sessions, improving user experience and continuity. [elizaos/eliza#6411](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6411)\n- Built a generic webhook service for stateless messaging plugins, increasing flexibility for integrations. [elizaos/eliza#6430](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6430)\n\n### Plugin & Integration Enhancements\n- Configured dynamic plugin loading based on user needs, allowing for more personalized and efficient resource utilization. [elizaos/eliza#6403](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6403)\n- Enabled Eliza to manage Google Calendar events, expanding its utility for scheduling and organization. [elizaos/eliza#6405](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6405)\n- Integrated Microsoft OAuth for Outlook calendar and email support, broadening compatibility with enterprise tools. [elizaos/eliza#6453](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6453)\n\n### Agent Security & OAuth Management\n- Set up a security sandbox for the auto agent VPS and Twitter integration, enhancing the security posture of agent operations. [elizaos/eliza#6434](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6434)\n- Enforced single OAuth connections per platform per user while linking Eliza App users to Cloud users, streamlining authentication and preventing redundancy. [elizaos/eliza#6462](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6462)\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**: A critical bug was reported where a URL in a message triggers duplicate LLM calls, leading to two responses. [elizaos/eliza#6486](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6486)\n- **elizaos/eliza**: The Renovate configuration has an error preventing new pull requests, requiring immediate resolution. [elizaos/eliza#6488](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6488)\n- **elizaos/eliza**: A UI enhancement request was made to add Discord as a fourth messaging option on the Eliza App landing site. [elizaos/eliza#6487](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6487)\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**: Implemented isolated user sessions for multi-tenant architecture.
