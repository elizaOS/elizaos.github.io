  "content": "Today, the ElizaOS project significantly advanced its data accessibility and core stability, with major enhancements to the static JSON API for summaries and leaderboards across multiple repositories, alongside critical bug fixes and permission system upgrades for the Discord plugin. A unified approach for JSON generation was adopted, ensuring data consistency and streamlining API structures.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### API & Data Infrastructure Enhancements\n*   **Static JSON API for Summaries and Leaderboards**: The static JSON API was extended to include summary endpoints, generating JSON alongside markdown for data consistency, and new static JSON API endpoints for leaderboard data were added with API versioning and pagination metadata. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#186](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/186), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#184](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/184))\n*   **Refined JSON API Endpoint Implementation**: The approach for adding JSON API endpoints for summaries was refined to generate JSON alongside markdown during the `summarize` command, ensuring synchronization and efficient data handling. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#185](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/185), [elizaos-plugins/registry#185](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/185), [elizaos/eliza#185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/185))\n\n### Plugin Stability & Permissions\n*   **Discord Bot Permission System**: A new tiered permission system for Discord bot invite URLs was implemented, along with hybrid slash-command permissions incorporating Discord permissions, channel-whitelist bypass, and custom validators. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#33](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/33), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/29))\n*   **Core Plugin Stability**: Critical bug fixes were implemented in the `plugin-bootstrap` module, addressing message format changes and ensuring proper exposure of `initPromise` for plugin utilization. ([elizaos/eliza#6261](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6261))\n\n### Registry Generation & UI/UX Improvements\n*   **Enhanced Registry Generation Logic**: The registry generation script was improved to detect version and core dependency mismatches and accurately set `supports` flags based on actual core dependencies. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#244](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/244))\n*   **UI/UX and Performance Enhancements**: Various UI/UX and performance issues were resolved, including optimizing Agent Builder model selection, fixing slow image loading, addressing layout inconsistencies, and improving login transitions. ([elizaos/eliza#6185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6185), [elizaos/eliza#6255](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6255), [elizaos/eliza#6252](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6252), [elizaos/eliza#6251](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6251), [elizaos/eliza#6253](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6253), [elizaos/eliza#6254](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6254))\n*   **Agent Builder and Content Rendering Improvements**: Improvements were made to the Agent Builder experience, including renaming the chat assistant, allowing JSON export without deployment, and fixing markdown bullet point rendering.
