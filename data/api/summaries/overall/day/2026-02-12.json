  "content": "On February 12, 2026, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in refining its core testing framework with the closure of several issues related to scenario testing and evaluators in `elizaos/eliza`. Additionally, `elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow` focused on internal script reorganization for clarity and introduced new API routes for workflow management. The `elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter` repository had no development activity.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Core Framework Enhancements & Testing Refinements**\n    - Enhanced scenario testing capabilities by closing an issue addressing the need for runtime method mocking for deterministic agent testing, improving reliability for LLM interactions. ([elizaos/eliza#5749](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5749))\n    - Introduced new scenario evaluators, including a Token Count Evaluator ([elizaos/eliza#5758](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5758)), a Cost Evaluator ([elizaos/eliza#5759](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5759)), a Consistency Evaluator ([elizaos/eliza#5760](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5760)), and a Step Count Evaluator ([elizaos/eliza#5761](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5761)).\n- **Internal Script & Documentation Maintenance**\n    - Reorganized and renamed internal crawl scripts in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow` for better descriptive accuracy, such as renaming `crawl-schemas.ts` to `crawl-output-schemas.ts`. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/17))\n    - Performed changelog maintenance in `elizaos/eliza` by removing all references from the `CHANGELOG.md` file. ([elizaos/eliza#6495](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6495))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **New Pull Requests**\n    - **elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow**\n        - Add REST API routes for workflow management: This pull request introduces new API endpoints to manage workflows. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16))\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n- **Closed Issues**\n    - **elizaos/eliza**\n        - Enhanced Scenario Testing Capabilities: Closed an issue addressing the need for runtime method mocking to enable deterministic agent testing, particularly for LLM interactions. ([elizaos/eliza#5749](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5749))\n        - New Scenario Evaluators Introduced: Resolved issues related to the implementation of several new evaluators for scenario testing, including a Token Count Evaluator ([elizaos/eliza#5758](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5758)), a Cost Evaluator ([elizaos/eliza#5759](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5759)), a Consistency Evaluator ([elizaos/eliza#5760](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5760)), and a Step Count Evaluator ([elizaos/eliza#5761](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5761))."
