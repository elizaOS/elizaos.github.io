  "content": "On February 12, 2026, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in refining its testing framework with the closure of several issues related to scenario testing and evaluators in `elizaos/eliza`. Additionally, new pull requests were opened to enhance plugin functionalities, including addressing authentication and media uploads in `plugin-twitter` and adding REST API routes for workflow management in `plugin-n8n-workflow`.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### Testing Framework Enhancements\n*   **Enhanced Scenario Testing Capabilities:** An issue addressing runtime method mocking for deterministic agent testing, particularly for LLM interactions, was closed, improving the reliability of scenario tests. [elizaos/eliza#5749](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5749)\n*   **New Scenario Evaluators Introduced:** Several new evaluators for scenario testing were added, including a Token Count Evaluator [elizaos/eliza#5758](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5758), a Cost Evaluator [elizaos/eliza#5759](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5759), a Consistency Evaluator [elizaos/eliza#5760](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5760), and a Step Count Evaluator [elizaos/eliza#5761](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5761).\n\n### Documentation and Script Refinement\n*   **Changelog Maintenance:** All references were removed from the `CHANGELOG.md` file. [elizaos/eliza#6495](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6495)\n*   **Script Reorganization for Clarity:** Internal crawl scripts in `plugin-n8n-workflow` were reorganized and renamed for better descriptive accuracy, such as `crawl-schemas.ts` to `crawl-output-schemas.ts`. [elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/17)\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n\n### New Pull Requests\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter**\n    *   [#48](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/48) aims to resolve issues with authentication retry loops, implement media upload functionality, and fix mention-related problems.\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow**\n    *   [#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/16) introduces new API routes to manage workflows.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n\n### Closed Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**\n    *   [#5749](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5749) Enhanced Scenario Testing Capabilities: Addressed the need for runtime method mocking for deterministic agent testing.\n    *   [#5758](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5758) New Scenario Evaluators Introduced: Token Count Evaluator.\n    *   [#5759](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5759) New Scenario Evaluators Introduced: Cost Evaluator.\n    *   [#5760](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5760) New Scenario Evaluators Introduced: Consistency Evaluator.\n    *   [#5761](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5761) New Scenario Evaluators Introduced: Step Count Evaluator."
