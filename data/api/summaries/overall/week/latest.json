  "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Feb 15 - 21, 2026)\n\nThis week, ElizaOS entered a high-velocity phase as it prepared for its official beta launch. The team successfully cleared a massive backlog of technical hurdles while simultaneously expanding the framework's reach into everyday communication tools like WhatsApp and Gmail. By combining core infrastructure upgrades with new decentralized identity features, the project is positioning itself as a robust, secure, and highly adaptable home for the next generation of AI agents.\n\n## Executive Summary\nElizaOS shifted its focus toward a major beta release, prioritizing user onboarding and platform stability. The project achieved significant milestones by integrating popular messaging and productivity apps and launching new on-chain identity tools for agents on the Solana blockchain.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Preparing for the Beta Launch and Beyond**\n*Goal: To ensure the platform is stable, user-friendly, and ready for its first 100 official testers.*\n*   The team cleared dozens of functional blockers in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), including fixing dashboard bugs and removing restrictive text limits to improve the user experience.\n*   A new \"Profile Plugin\" was proposed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to automatically build user profiles from social media, making it easier for new users to get started immediately.\n*   Efforts are underway in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the AI's personality, aiming for a more direct and engaging conversational style for the launch.\n\n**Expanding Agent Reach and Utility**\n*Goal: To allow AI agents to work across more platforms and handle more complex tasks.*\n*   Major integrations were finalized for WhatsApp, Gmail, and the N8N workflow engine in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), allowing agents to communicate and automate tasks where users already work.\n*   The [elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow) repository added a new \"control panel\" (REST API), giving developers a way to manage complex workflows directly without needing to use natural language.\n*   The plugin registry in [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) saw a surge in new tools, particularly for Web3 and financial data exchanges.\n\n**Strengthening Security and Decentralization**\n*Goal: To give agents a verifiable identity and ensure the system remains secure as it grows.*\n*   The project introduced the SAID Protocol in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) and [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry), which gives agents a \"digital passport\" on the Solana blockchain for secure, verifiable actions.\n*   A security audit was completed for the Model Context Protocol in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), ensuring that as agents share information, they do so safely.\n\n**Improving System Health and Maintenance**\n*Goal: To keep the project's \"engine\" running smoothly and make it easier for community members to contribute.*\n*   A major database overhaul was started in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to make the system faster and more reliable for the long term.\n*   Critical fixes to the automated review system in [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) ensured that outside contributors can have their work checked and merged more quickly.\n*   Routine but essential security updates were performed across the documentation site in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io) to keep the project's public face secure.\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n*   **Unified Identity Standards**: The implementation of the SAID Protocol required synchronized work between the core framework [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) and the [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) to ensure agents can use their new on-chain identities across all plugins.\n*   **Workflow Automation**: The N8N workflow integration involved coordinated updates in the core repository [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) and the specific [elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow) repo to provide a seamless experience for managing complex AI tasks.\n*   **Automated Maintenance**: The team successfully fixed \"Renovate\" (an automated update tool) in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), which now helps keep dependencies across the entire ecosystem up to date automatically.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   Initiated a major database refactor ([#6509](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6509)) to improve long-term system architecture.\n*   Integrated the SAID Protocol for on-chain Solana identity ([#6510](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6510)), enabling verifiable agent signatures.\n*   Finalized major integrations for WhatsApp ([#6401](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6401)), Gmail ([#6404](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6404)), and N8N ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429)).\n*   Resolved critical automated update issues ([#6488](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6488)) and enabled multi-language dependency management ([#6506](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6506), [#6507](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6507)).\n*   Added support for the Opus 4.5 model ([#6368](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6368)) and Chain-of-Thought reasoning ([#6294](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6294)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\n*   Expanded the
