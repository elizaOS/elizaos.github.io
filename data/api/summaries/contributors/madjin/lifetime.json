Holds 54% of merged PRs in `elizaos/elizaos.github.io`, indicating primary maintainer status for the community dashboard.\n- **Work Structure:** **MEDIUM**. Low issue linkage (5% of PRs close issues), suggesting work is self-directed or coordinated through external channels rather than GitHub issue tracking.\n- **Review Dependencies:** **HIGH**. Relies heavily on @odilitime (8 reviews) and @monilpat (6 reviews) for merging, creating a specific reviewer dependency loop."
