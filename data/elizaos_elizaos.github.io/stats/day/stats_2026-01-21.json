      "body": "<!-- greptile_comment -->\n\n<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>\n\n### Greptile Summary\n\nThis PR enhances the profile summary card by adding markdown rendering support using `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm`. The change replaces plain text rendering with proper markdown formatting, allowing headers, lists, links, and other markdown elements in AI-generated contributor summaries to display correctly.\n\n**What Changed:**\n- Added `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` imports\n- Replaced `<p>` element with `<div>` wrapped `<ReactMarkdown>` component\n- Added Tailwind Typography prose classes for consistent markdown styling\n- Configured prose classes to match the card's design system (custom spacing, colors for headings, dark mode support)\n\n**Integration with Codebase:**\nThe summary content is AI-generated markdown from the pipeline (see `src/lib/pipelines/summarize/aiContributorSummary.ts`), which produces structured markdown with headers, lists, and links. This change ensures that markdown renders correctly in the profile summary cards, matching the pattern already used in `SummaryContent.tsx` for full summary pages.\n\n**Security:**\n`react-markdown` is safe by default - it sanitizes HTML and only renders markdown elements unless explicitly configured with `rehype-raw` plugin (which is not used here). The summary data comes from the database, populated by server-side AI generation, so there's no user-controlled input risk.\n\n**Issue Found:**\nThe existing truncation logic (line 53) slices at character 300, which can break markdown syntax by cutting through links, headers, or other elements. This needs to be addressed with markdown-aware truncation or an alternative approach.\n\n### Confidence Score: 3/5\n\n- This PR is safe to merge with caution - the markdown rendering is implemented correctly, but the truncation logic will cause rendering issues for long lifetime summaries\n- Score of 3 reflects that while the core markdown rendering implementation is correct and secure (proper use of react-markdown with GFM support, appropriate styling), there is a logic bug where the existing character-based truncation will break markdown syntax. This issue only affects lifetime summaries longer than 300 characters when not expanded. The bug won't cause crashes or security issues, but will result in malformed markdown rendering. The positive aspects are: libraries are already in dependencies, security is handled correctly by react-markdown's default sanitization, styling matches the design system, and the pattern is consistent with other markdown rendering in the codebase.\n- src/components/summary-card.tsx - specifically the truncation logic at lines 48-54 which needs to be made markdown-aware\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\nFile Analysis\n\n\n\n| Filename | Score | Overview |\n|----------|-------|----------|\n| src/components/summary-card.tsx | 3/5 | Adds markdown rendering to profile summaries but has a critical bug where character-based truncation can break markdown syntax mid-element |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant ProfilePage as Profile Page\n    participant SummaryCard as Summary Card\n    participant ReactMarkdown as React Markdown\n    participant RemarkGFM as Remark GFM Plugin\n    \n    User->>ProfilePage: Visit /profile/[username]\n    ProfilePage->>ProfilePage: Fetch user data from DB\n    Note over ProfilePage: Includes lifetimeSummary,<br/>monthlySummaries,<br/>weeklySummaries\n    ProfilePage->>SummaryCard: Render with summaries prop\n    \n    alt Lifetime summary & length > 300\n        SummaryCard->>SummaryCard: Truncate at char 300\n        Note over SummaryCard: ⚠️ May break markdown syntax\n    end\n    \n    SummaryCard->>ReactMarkdown: Pass displayText\n    ReactMarkdown->>RemarkGFM: Process markdown with GFM\n    RemarkGFM->>ReactMarkdown: Return parsed AST\n    ReactMarkdown->>ReactMarkdown: Render to React elements\n    ReactMarkdown->>SummaryCard: Rendered markdown\n    SummaryCard->>User: Display formatted content\n    \n    alt User clicks \"Show more/less\"\n        User->>SummaryCard: Toggle isExpanded\n        SummaryCard->>SummaryCard: Re-render with full/truncated text\n    end\n```\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
