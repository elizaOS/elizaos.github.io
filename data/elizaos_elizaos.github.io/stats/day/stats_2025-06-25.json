      "body": "The new caching logic for fetching wallet addresses isnt ideal because its fetching from github during the NextJS build instead of in the Pipelines workflow where all the other github data fetching happens.\n\nShould update frontend build so it only queries the database for wallet addresses, and move the logic for fetching wallet addresses from github into the ingest pipeline. Additionally, githubService.ts should be deprecated in favour of the github.ts class that already exists.",
