      "body": "### Integrate Ethereum Name Service to WalletLinkForm.\r\nOn /profile/edit page, Instead of inputting user's full wallet address, user will also be able to reference one's wallet address by providing an ENS domain. \r\nConsidering the risk that an ENS domain gets expired or transferred and the user neglects to adjust one's README.md hidden comment, ENS is only used for initially getting the corresponding wallet address on WalletLinkForm, anything beyond resolves to the raw address.\r\n![ens](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edb39bda-5e71-4316-bb83-7977e6a87ab4)\r\n\r\nIf this flow makes sense, the same can perhaps be done for SNS (Solana Name Service)\r\n\r\nResolve #120 \n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **New Features**\n  * Added support for linking Ethereum and Solana wallets using human-readable domain names (ENS for Ethereum and SNS for Solana) in addition to raw addresses.\n  * Wallet linking forms now validate and resolve ENS and SNS domains to their underlying blockchain addresses.\n\n* **Bug Fixes**\n  * Improved wallet address validation by making it asynchronous, ensuring more accurate validation and error handling.\n\n* **Chores**\n  * Added new dependencies to enable ENS and SNS domain resolution and validation.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
