      "body": "## Problem\n\nUpgrading Next.js from 15.2.6 to 15.4.10+ (or 16.x) causes build failures with:\n\n```\nError: Functions cannot be passed directly to Client Components unless you explicitly expose it by marking it with \"use server\". Or maybe you meant to call this function rather than return it.\n  {$$typeof: ..., render: function, displayName: ...}\n```\n\nAffected route: `/summary/[interval]/[[...date]]/page`\n\n## Root Cause\n\n`StatCardsDisplay` is an async server component that passes pre-rendered JSX elements to `StatCard` (client component) via the `modalContent` prop:\n\n```tsx\n// src/app/summary/[interval]/[[...date]]/components/StatCardsDisplay.tsx\n<StatCard\n  modalContent={<ContributorsListModalContent contributors={metrics.topContributors} />}\n>\n```\n\nReact elements contain render functions which aren't serializable across the RSC boundary. This worked in 15.2.6 but stricter versions catch this violation.\n\n## Solutions\n\nFrom [Next.js discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/49625):\n\n1. **Make StatCardsDisplay a client component** - Add `\"use client\"` directive\n2. **Pass data instead of JSX** - Pass serializable props, render modal content inside client component\n3. **Use composition pattern** - Use `children` prop which has special RSC handling\n\nRecommended approach: Option 2 - refactor `StatCard` to accept a `modalContentType` + `modalData` props instead of pre-rendered JSX.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `src/components/stat-card.tsx` - Already has `\"use client\"`, needs prop refactor\n- `src/app/summary/[interval]/[[...date]]/components/StatCardsDisplay.tsx` - Pass data not JSX\n- Modal content components may need to move inside stat-card or be lazy-imported\n\n## Current Workaround\n\nStay on Next.js 15.2.6 until this refactor is complete.\n\n## References\n\n- [Next.js Discussion #49625](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/49625)\n- [Next.js Issue #42408](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/42408)\n- [How to Fix Guide](https://www.timsanteford.com/posts/how-to-fix-functions-cannot-be-passed-directly-to-client-components-error-in-next-js/)\n\n## Related PRs\n\n- PR #175 - RSS feed fix (separate issue)",

      "body": "## Problem: Sequential Processing is Too Slow for Multi-Repo Pipelines\n\n### Current Bottleneck\n\nThe current pipeline uses **static concurrency** which creates a performance vs reliability tradeoff:\n\n- **Low concurrency (current: 5)**: Safe but SLOW\n  - 23 repos × 52 weeks of data = **~10-15 hours** for full ingestion\n  - Single slow repo blocks entire pipeline\n  - Underutilizes available API quota (5,000 requests/hour)\n\n- **High concurrency**: Fast but RISKY\n  - Hits secondary rate limits frequently\n  - Forces pipeline to wait 15+ minutes\n  - Wastes time with retry backoff cycles\n\n### Real-World Impact\n\n**Example from M3-org fork** (14 Optimism repositories):\n- **Static concurrency=5**: 6-8 hours for full historical ingestion\n- **With adaptive concurrency**: 2-3 hours (60% faster)\n- **Rate limit hits**: Reduced from 10-15 to 2-3 per run\n\n**Projected for 23 elizaOS repositories:**\n- **Current static approach**: 10-15 hours\n- **With adaptive concurrency**: ~4-6 hours (60-70% faster)\n\n### Why Static Concurrency Fails\n\n1. **API health varies** - Morning vs evening, weekday vs weekend\n2. **Repository sizes differ** - Small repos finish fast, large repos take hours\n3. **Rate limit recovery** - After hitting limit, pipeline should slow down temporarily\n4. **Unnecessary conservatism** - Static concurrency=5 is safe but wastes quota\n\n---\n\n## Solution: Adaptive Concurrency Management\n\n### Core Concept\n\n**Dynamically adjust concurrent operations (3-8) based on rate limit health:**\n\n- **Start conservative**: 3 concurrent operations\n- **Increase on success**: +1 concurrency every 2 minutes without rate limits\n- **Decrease on rate limit**: Halve concurrency immediately\n- **Track health**: Remember last rate limit for 5 minutes\n\n### Performance Benchmarks\n\n**Test Setup**: M3-org/op-hiscores fork with 14 ethereum-optimism repos\n\n| Metric | Static (5) | Adaptive (3-8) | Improvement |\n|--------|-----------|----------------|-------------|\n| **Total duration** | 6h 45min | 2h 50min | **58% faster** |\n| **Rate limit hits** | 12 | 2 | **83% fewer** |\n| **Avg concurrency** | 5 | 5.8 | +16% |\n| **Recovery time** | 3h 20min | 45min | **77% faster** |\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Components\n\n### 1. Adaptive Concurrency Manager (~110 lines)\n```typescript\nclass AdaptiveConcurrencyManager {\n  currentLevel: 3-8 (starts at 3)\n  reduceOnSecondaryLimit() → currentLevel / 2\n  increaseOnSuccess() → currentLevel + 1 (if no rate limit in 2min)\n  shouldReduceLoad() → true if rate limited in last 5min\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Rate Limit Type Detection (~50 lines)\n- Distinguishes **primary** vs **secondary** rate limits\n- Different strategies for each type\n- Primary: Wait until reset (1hr)\n- Secondary: Reduce load + backoff (15min)\n\n### 3. Adaptive Pipeline Integration (~60 lines)\n```typescript\nmapStep(operation, {\n  adaptiveConcurrency: true,  // Enable dynamic adjustment\n  defaultConcurrency: 5       // Fallback\n})\n```\n\n### 4. API Cost Estimation (~75 lines)\n- Shows estimated duration BEFORE execution\n- `--estimate-only` flag for dry-run\n- Risk assessment (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)\n\n### 5. Graceful Shutdown (~30 lines)\n- First Ctrl+C: Complete current operation, preserve adaptive state\n- Second Ctrl+C: Force exit\n- Better for long-running multi-hour ingestions\n\n**Total**: ~348 lines across 4 files\n\n---\n\n## Production Testing\n\n- **Fork**: https://github.com/M3-org/op-hiscores\n- **Deployment**: https://m3-org.github.io/op-hiscores/\n- **Dataset**: 14 repos, 18,000+ PRs, 4,800+ issues\n- **Duration**: 6+ months in production\n- **Commit**: `309c37c` - feat: Enhance pipeline with adaptive rate limiting\n\n---\n\n## Trade-offs\n\n### Pros\n✅ **60-70% faster** for multi-repo ingestion\n✅ **75% fewer rate limit hits**\n✅ **Self-tuning** - No manual configuration needed\n✅ **Production-tested** - 14 repos, 18K+ PRs successfully processed\n✅ **Backward compatible** - Opt-in via `adaptiveConcurrency: true`\n\n### Cons\n⚠️ **Complexity** - 348 lines vs current static approach\n⚠️ **Tuning** - Thresholds (3-8, 2min, 5min) may not be optimal for all workloads\n⚠️ **Debugging** - Dynamic behavior is harder to reason about\n\n---\n\n## Value Proposition\n\nFor projects tracking **10+ repositories** (like this project with 23 repos), the difference between **15 hours and 4-6 hours** for full ingestion is substantial.\n\nThe self-tuning nature means:\n- No manual configuration needed\n- Automatically finds optimal concurrency\n- Scales better as more repos are added\n- Reduces developer waiting time by 6-10 hours per full ingestion\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this enhancement aligns with the project's goals, I'm happy to:\n1. Submit a PR with the full implementation\n2. Provide additional benchmarks or testing\n3. Adjust parameters based on your specific workload\n4. Start with a subset (e.g., just rate limit type detection) if preferred\n\nThe implementation is production-ready and has been thoroughly tested with larger datasets than currently tracked by this project.\n\n---\n\n**Question for maintainers**: Is the ~60% performance improvement worth the additional complexity? Would you prefer the full enhancement or a smaller subset (e.g., just rate limit parsing)?\n",

      "body": "## Summary\n\nThe current leaderboard search uses simple string matching (`.toLowerCase().includes()`), which requires exact substring matches. Upgrading to fuzzy search would improve user experience.\n\n## Current Implementation\n\n```typescript\n// src/components/leaderboard.tsx:141\nuser.username.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())\n```\n\nThis requires exact matches - searching \"shwa\" won't find \"shaw\".\n\n## Proposed Enhancement\n\nUse `fuzzysort` (already in package.json but unused) for typo-tolerant matching:\n\n```typescript\nimport fuzzysort from 'fuzzysort';\n\n// Instead of exact matching:\nconst filteredUsers = fuzzysort.go(searchTerm, users, { key: 'username' })\n  .map(result => result.obj);\n```\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Typo tolerance**: \"shwa\" → finds \"shaw\"\n- **Partial matching**: \"wtfis\" → finds \"wtfisagi0\"  \n- **Ranked results**: Best matches appear first\n- **Fast**: Optimized for real-time filtering\n\n## Context\n\n- `fuzzysort` was added in commit `4fe3c624` (2025-01-21) during SQLite implementation\n- Search UI was added in PR #92 but used simple matching\n- Package is already installed, just needs to be imported and used\n\n## Related\n\n- See #173 for dependency audit (lists `fuzzysort` as currently unused)",

      "author": "madjin",
      "number": 171,
      "repository": "elizaos/elizaos.github.io",
      "body": "## Context\n\nSeveral organizations are running forks of this project to track their own GitHub organizations:\n- **M3-org/op-hiscores** - Tracking Optimism ecosystem repos\n- **Sendo-labs fork** - Custom deployment\n\nThese forks want to stay current with upstream features (badges, rate limiting, API improvements) but face challenges keeping in sync.\n\n## Current Pain Points\n\n### 1. Config conflicts on every sync\n`config/pipeline.config.ts` contains:\n- Repository list (org-specific)\n- AI context/prompts (org-specific branding)\n- Scoring rules (potentially org-specific)\n\nEvery upstream merge requires manual conflict resolution.\n\n### 2. Scattered org-specific values\nHardcoded values appear in multiple places:\n- `src/lib/pipelines/summarize/callAIService.ts` - `SITE_URL` default\n- `src/app/about/page.tsx` - Hardcoded links\n- CSS files - Brand colors\n- Various components - Org-specific text\n\n### 3. No clear separation of concerns\nNo distinction between:\n- **Core code** - Should always sync from upstream\n- **Deployment config** - Should stay fork-specific\n- **Branding/theming** - Should be configurable\n\n### 4. Cherry-picking is error-prone\nUseful features often come bundled with org-specific changes in the same commits, making clean cherry-picks difficult.\n\n## Proposed Improvements\n\n### Externalized Configuration\n\n1. **Single config file for all org-specific values**\n   ```typescript\n   // config/deployment.config.ts (gitignored)\n   export default {\n     siteName: \"ElizaOS Contributors\",\n     siteUrl: \"https://elizaos.github.io\",\n     repositories: [...],\n     branding: {\n       primaryColor: \"#...\",\n       logo: \"/logo.svg\",\n     },\n     aiContext: \"We are ElizaOS...\",\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Provide a `.example` template**\n   ```\n   config/deployment.config.example.ts  ← Committed\n   config/deployment.config.ts          ← Gitignored, fork-specific\n   ```\n\n3. **Environment variable fallbacks**\n   ```typescript\n   const siteUrl = config.siteUrl || process.env.SITE_URL;\n   ```\n\n### README Deployment Section\n\nAdd a \"Deploying Your Own Instance\" section to README covering:\n- How to fork and configure for your org\n- Which files to customize vs. keep in sync\n- Recommended workflow for pulling upstream updates\n- Example deployment configs for reference\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Cleaner git history** - Forks can `git pull upstream main` without conflicts\n2. **Easier feature adoption** - New features \"just work\" after pull\n3. **Reduced maintenance burden** - Fork maintainers focus on config, not merge conflicts\n4. **Better contributor experience** - Clear separation of what to modify\n\n## Questions for Discussion\n\n1. Would upstream accept PRs to externalize configuration?\n2. Is there interest in officially supporting \"white-label\" deployments?\n3. Are there other forks we should coordinate with?\n\n---\n\nHappy to help implement whichever approach the maintainers prefer!",
