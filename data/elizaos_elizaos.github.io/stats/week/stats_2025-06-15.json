Additionally, githubService.ts should be deprecated in favour of the github.ts class that already exists.",

      "author": "madjin",
      "number": 124,
      "body": "This commit introduces a gold checkmark icon next to the username on your user profile page for users who have linked their Ethereum or Solana wallets.\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n- Added a new `GoldCheckmarkIcon.tsx` component to display an SVG checkmark.\r\n- Modified `UserProfile.tsx` to:\r\n    - Fetch wallet information using the existing `getUserWalletData` function.\r\n    - Conditionally display the `GoldCheckmarkIcon` next to the username if a wallet address (`ethAddress` or `solAddress`) is present.\r\n    - Wrap the icon with a `Tooltip` component that shows \"Wallet linked\" on hover.\r\n- Ensured the icon is styled appropriately using Tailwind CSS and aligns correctly with the username.\r\n\r\nThe icon provides a clear visual indicator of wallet verification, enhancing user trust and information clarity on the profile page. I confirmed correct functionality through manual code review and scenario simulation.\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n- **New Features**\n  - Introduced support for linking multiple blockchain wallets (e.g., Ethereum, Solana) to user profiles, with a unified system for managing and displaying linked wallets.\n  - Added visual indicators (badges and tooltips) for users with linked wallets on profile and leaderboard pages.\n  - Implemented robust wallet address validation and chain support logic.\n\n- **Enhancements**\n  - Improved leaderboard and profile displays to show all linked wallets, replacing previous Ethereum/Solana-only handling.\n  - Streamlined wallet data retrieval and caching for faster, more reliable updates.\n  - Expanded documentation with detailed guides on pipelines, workflows, and wallet linking.\n\n- **Database Changes**\n  - Added a new table for wallet addresses and updated the users table to track wallet data updates.\n  - Updated database schema and migration scripts to support wallet linking features.\n\n- **Bug Fixes**\n  - Improved error handling and logging for wallet data retrieval and processing.\n\n- **Chores**\n  - Updated dependencies and refined internal workflows for data pipelines and deployment.\n  - Refactored and removed obsolete code and hooks related to wallet linking.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
