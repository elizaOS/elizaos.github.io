## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Web Client Version Mismatch and API Spamming:** Discussions continue regarding the web client displaying an incorrect version (`v1.0.3` vs. `v1.0.4` for CLI/core) and repeatedly spamming the GitHub API, leading to 429 errors and significant memory consumption. A comment from June 20th indicates that the issue might be fixed, but a later comment from June 23rd suggests the version mismatch persists even in `v1.0.11`. ([#4924](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/4924))
*   **Checking Loaded Plugins:** A user inquired about how to check currently loaded plugins in a running agent. A comment from June 20th provided a log example showing how to identify the final plugins being loaded. ([#4931](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/4931))
