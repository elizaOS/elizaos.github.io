## NEW ISSUES
### Performance Enhancement for Multi-Repo Ingestion
A new enhancement issue, [#159](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/159), was created to address the slow sequential processing in multi-repository pipelines. The issue highlights that the current static concurrency creates a trade-off between performance and reliability, with low concurrency being safe but slow. The proposed solution is adaptive rate limiting to achieve 60% faster multi-repo ingestion.
