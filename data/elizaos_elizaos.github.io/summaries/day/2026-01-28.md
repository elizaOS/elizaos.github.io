## ACTIVE ISSUES

### N8N Workflow Engine Integration Discussion
Discussions are ongoing regarding the integration of the N8N workflow engine as the primary automation layer for Eliza App. A contributor, spider-yamet, has proposed a detailed solution approach, outlining a `plugin-n8n` with components for N8N service, workflow actions, context providers, and task workers. The proposal includes specific deliverables such as a complete package, database schema, various actions (CREATE_WORKFLOW, EXECUTE_WORKFLOW, LIST_WORKFLOWS, DELETE_WORKFLOW), providers, documentation, and tests. The contributor is seeking approval to implement this feature. ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6429))
