### N8N Workflow Engine Integration
Discussions are ongoing regarding the integration of the N8N workflow engine as the primary automation layer for Eliza App. A detailed proposal has been put forward, outlining a `plugin-n8n` with four main components: an N8N Service, Workflow Actions, Context Providers, and Task Workers. The proposal also specifies deliverables including the complete package, database schema for workflow storage, various actions (CREATE_WORKFLOW, EXECUTE_WORKFLOW, LIST_WORKFLOWS, DELETE_WORKFLOW), providers, documentation, and tests.
