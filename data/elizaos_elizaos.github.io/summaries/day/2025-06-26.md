## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Character File Size Limit
Discussion on [#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5268) highlights an `Error 500: request entity too large` when attempting to save large character files (e.g., 150kb JSON). The team is tasked with increasing the file size limit to 100MB for characters, implementing a regression test to identify and fix the bug.

### User Identity Management
The issue of "split personality" due to GitHub username changes is being discussed in [#105](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/105). The current system uses GitHub usernames as primary keys, leading to split contributions when a username changes. A proposed solution involves reworking the system to use GitHub internal IDs as the base identifier, allowing for username changes without affecting user profiles. This would require updating the database to link multiple identities to a single user and modifying data ingestion processes. Challenges include the current primary key structure and handling edge cases like multiple username changes.
