## CLOSED ISSUES

### Clarification on "Entity not found" in Reflection Evaluator
Issue [#6364](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6364), concerning "Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' - UPDATE_CONTACT requires entity initialization," was closed. It was determined that this behavior is not a bug but rather an intended design. The `ensureConnection()` function correctly initializes user entities, and the "Entity not found" occurs when the agent attempts to create relationships with individuals mentioned in conversation who are not present in the room, which is handled gracefully by skipping the relationship.

No new issues were reported today.
