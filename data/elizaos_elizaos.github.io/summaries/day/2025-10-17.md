# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Oct 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing repository tracking and bot exclusion for analytics, alongside addressing critical documentation and deployment issues. Several new pull requests and issues were opened to improve the project's robustness and user experience.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Analytics Pipeline Enhancements
The analytics pipeline was updated to include the `elizaos/docs` repository for tracking contributor analytics. Additionally, "claude" was added to the bot users exclusion list to filter out Claude Code contributions from analytics, ensuring more accurate reporting. ([#151](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/151))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Deployment Guide for Forks**: A new pull request ([#158](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/158)) was opened to add a deployment guide specifically for users forking the repository.
- **Dynamic Stats Copying**: A fix ([#157](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/157)) was proposed to dynamically copy statistics for all tracked repositories, addressing a hardcoded path issue.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Plugin Documentation and Scaffolding Fixes
An issue regarding incorrect plugin documentation and scaffolding problems ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6070)) was closed. The fix involved:
- Correcting template lookup paths to include monorepo package directories.
- Updating CLI command syntax in multiple README files from `-t` to `--type`.
- Fixing command examples in CLI help messages.

## NEW ISSUES

### Deployment Workflow Hardcoding
A bug was reported ([#153](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/153)) where the deploy workflow hardcodes a single repository path, preventing dynamic handling of multiple repositories.

### Missing Deployment Guide for Forks
An issue was created ([#154](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/154)) highlighting the lack of documentation on how to fork and deploy the project to GitHub Pages, specifically regarding `basePath` configuration.

### Ingestion Pipeline Enhancements
Two new enhancement issues were opened:
- **API Cost Estimation**: An enhancement to add API cost estimation to the ingestion pipeline ([#156](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/156)) was proposed to prevent unexpected consumption of GitHub API calls.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: An enhancement to add graceful shutdown to the CLI pipeline ([#155](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/155)) was suggested to improve handling of long-running ingestion processes.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Plugin Documentation Inaccuracies ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6070))
The discussion on this issue revolved around significant frustration regarding the plugin documentation and scaffolding process. Initially, a user expressed strong dissatisfaction with the documentation's accuracy, stating it was impossible to scaffold a plugin by following the existing guides. Claude bot then intervened, identifying and fixing several root issues, including incorrect template lookup paths and erroneous CLI command syntax in multiple documentation files. The bot provided a detailed breakdown of the fixes implemented. Following this, a maintainer (yungalgo) engaged with the frustrated user, offering assistance and clarifying the nature of open-source projects regarding documentation parity, while also indicating that rage posting would lead to issue closure. The issue was subsequently closed after the fixes were implemented.
