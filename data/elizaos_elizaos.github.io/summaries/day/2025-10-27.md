## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced API Performance with Adaptive Rate Limiting
*   Implemented adaptive rate limiting with low-volume optimization for GitHub API operations, significantly improving performance for high-volume repositories while maintaining zero overhead for typical workloads. ([#160](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/160))

### Introduction of Contributor Badge System
*   Implemented a minimal viable product (MVP) badge/achievement system with 5 badge types across 3 tier levels (beginner/elite/legend) to recognize contributor achievements. ([#161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/161))
*   Designed the badge system with DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principles to minimize code overhead. ([#161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/161))
