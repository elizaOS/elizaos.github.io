## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced GitHub API Performance with Adaptive Rate Limiting
Adaptive rate limiting with low-volume optimization was implemented to significantly improve performance for high-volume GitHub API operations while maintaining zero overhead for typical workloads. This enhancement ensures more efficient data ingestion and processing. ([#160](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/160))

### Introduction of MVP Badge System for Contributor Recognition
A minimal and efficient badge/achievement system was introduced, featuring 5 badge types across 3 tier levels (beginner/elite/legend). This system is designed with DRY and YAGNI principles to minimize code overhead, fostering contributor engagement and recognition. ([#161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/161))
