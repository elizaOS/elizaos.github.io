# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significantly enhancing the static JSON API, introducing new endpoints for both leaderboard and summary data. This work streamlines data access and improves the overall extensibility of the platform.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Static JSON API for Summaries
The static JSON API was extended to include summary endpoints, generating JSON alongside markdown during the summarization process. This "piggyback" approach ensures data consistency and simplifies the API structure by removing unnecessary pagination fields from the leaderboard API.
