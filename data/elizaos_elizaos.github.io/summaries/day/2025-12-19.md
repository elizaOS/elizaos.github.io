# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significantly enhancing the static JSON API, introducing new endpoints for both leaderboard and summary data. This work streamlines data access and improves the overall extensibility of the platform.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Static JSON API for Summaries
The static JSON API was extended to include summary endpoints, generating JSON alongside markdown during the summarization process. This "piggyback" approach ensures data consistency and simplifies the API structure. The leaderboard API was also simplified by removing unnecessary pagination fields. ([#186](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/186))

### Introduction of Static JSON Leaderboard API Endpoints
New static JSON API endpoints for leaderboard data were added at `/data/api/leaderboard-{period}.json`. These endpoints include API versioning (v1.0) for future compatibility and pagination metadata. ([#184](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/184))

### Implementation of JSON API Endpoints for Summaries
The issue concerning the addition of JSON API endpoints for summaries was closed today. This feature extends the static JSON API to include summary endpoints, building upon the existing leaderboard endpoints. The refined approach involved generating JSON alongside markdown during the `summarize` command, ensuring JSON artifacts are always in sync with markdown and the database.
