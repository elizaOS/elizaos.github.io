### Agent Not Responding with Google API
Issue [#5664](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5664) reported an agent failing to respond when using the Google API. Initial diagnosis by Claude incorrectly suggested the `plugin-google-genai` did not exist. This was corrected by `wtfsayo`, confirming the plugin's existence in `elizaos-plugins`. The root cause was identified as a missing or incorrectly configured `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` environment variable. Solutions provided included verifying the API key, setting it correctly in the `.env` file, and restarting the agent. The issue was resolved by `1BDO` confirming the fix.
