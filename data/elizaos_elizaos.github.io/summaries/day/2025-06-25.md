# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jun 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant improvements to wallet address ingestion speed and refactoring the GitHub data fetching logic, alongside addressing critical issues related to plugin functionality and agent responses.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Wallet Address Ingestion
The ingestion speed for wallet addresses has been significantly improved by implementing batched GraphQL requests to mitigate rate limiting. This change streamlines the process of fetching wallet data from GitHub.
- Implemented batch processing for fetching wallet addresses, improving efficiency and mitigating rate limits. ([#134](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/134))
- Introduced a new pipeline step for ingesting user wallet addresses, including tracking of successful ingests. ([#132](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/132))

### Refactored GitHub Data Fetching
The `githubService` has been removed and its functionality integrated into an updated `github.ts` class, centralizing and improving the maintainability of GitHub data interactions.
- Removed the `githubService` and updated the `github.ts` class to replace its functionality. ([#132](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/132))
- Reverted workflow changes and set up Gemini, as fetching addresses is now handled by pipelines. ([#133](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/133))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Wallet Address Fetching Optimization
The issue concerning wallet address fetching during the NextJS build process has been resolved by moving this functionality to the pipelines workflow, aligning it with other GitHub data fetching operations.
- Resolved the issue of fetching wallet addresses during NextJS build by migrating the process to pipelines. ([#130](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/130))

### Plugin Configuration and Error Resolution
A critical bug related to the `TEXT_EMBEDDING` delegate type has been fixed by ensuring the agent character file includes the necessary OpenAI plugin.
- Fixed the "No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING" error by adding the `@elizaos/plugin-openai` to the agent character file. ([#5279](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5279))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Custom Plugin Development Challenges
Users are encountering difficulties with custom plugin development, specifically with the Eliza agent only processing a single message before stopping plugin usage. A user noted a similar experience with errors during custom plugin development. Another user observed that while the agent replies correctly in the terminal, the response doesn't always appear in the interface logs, indicating a potential display or message bus issue. ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5260))

### Twitter Plugin Reply Issues
The Twitter plugin is failing to post replies to mentions or tags, despite successful loading and enabled configurations. A user reported that memories are being saved, but the response is not being delivered, suggesting a potential drop-off in the response flow. It was also noted that newlines in timeline replies are being replaced with `\\n\\n` instead of actual line breaks, which appears as raw text on Twitter. This is attributed to the template explicitly instructing the agent to use `\\n`.
