# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jan 22, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes related to API data export and summary generation. Key achievements include resolving issues with missing API files, ensuring overall summaries are generated even for days with no activity, and correcting the pipeline ordering for contributor summaries in stats files.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### API Data Export and Consistency Improvements
A significant bug was addressed that prevented the export of the API index and contributor profiles due to a missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow. This fix ensures that all 1,433 contributor profiles and the API index are correctly generated and accessible. Additionally, a problem where overall summaries were not generated for days without repository activity, leading to 404 errors, was resolved. Now, a "No activity recorded" message is provided for such days, ensuring consistent API behavior.

### Pipeline Ordering for Contributor Summaries
A pipeline ordering issue was identified and fixed, which previously caused contributor summaries to always appear as `null` in exported stats files. The correction ensures that contributor summaries are re-exported after their generation, providing accurate data in the `stats_*.json` files.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#227](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/227) Fix API issues: missing files and no-activity summaries: This pull request aims to resolve problems with missing API files and ensure summaries are generated even for days with no activity.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Resolution of API Export Failures
Two critical issues causing API endpoints to return 404 errors were resolved. The first involved the `/api/index.json` and contributor profile endpoints, which were not being exported due to a missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow. This was fixed by adding dynamic `SITE_URL` detection. The second issue addressed overall summary API endpoints returning 404 for dates with no repository activity; now, a "No activity recorded" summary is generated for such days, ensuring consistent API responses.

### Fix for Null Contributor Summaries in Stats Files
A problem where contributor summaries were consistently `null` in exported stats files was identified and closed. The root cause was a pipeline ordering issue, which has now been addressed to ensure that contributor summaries are correctly included in the stats files.
