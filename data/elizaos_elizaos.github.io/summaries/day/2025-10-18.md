### Ingestion Pipeline Enhancements Reviewed and Closed
Two enhancement issues related to the ingestion pipeline were reviewed and subsequently closed. The proposed API cost estimation was deemed redundant due to the existing sophisticated GitHub client rate limiting, which includes a token bucket system, automatic throttling, and handling of secondary rate limits, actively preventing rate limit exhaustion rather than just estimating it ([#156](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/156)). Similarly, the suggestion for graceful shutdown in the CLI pipeline was closed as the pipeline already handles interruptions gracefully by continuously saving progress to the SQLite database and allowing for seamless resumption of processing without data loss ([#155](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/155)).
