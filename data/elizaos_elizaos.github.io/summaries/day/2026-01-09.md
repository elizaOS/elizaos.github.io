## NEW ISSUES

### Character Class System Development
Several new issues were opened to define a comprehensive character class system. This includes implementing a full Orders & Evolution class tree with progression paths from base to mastery ([#194](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/194)), allowing users to choose their evolution path at tier thresholds ([#195](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/195)), and tracking class evolution history for rich profile lore display ([#196](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/196)).

### Visual Identity and Configurability for Orders
Further enhancements to the character system involve adding a unique visual identity system for each Order, including primary colors, accents, and sigils ([#197](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/197)). Additionally, an issue was created to allow class respec with history preservation for lore purposes ([#198](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/198)), and to make character class thresholds configurable via `config/example.json` ([#199](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/199)).

### Reporting Format Extension
An issue was opened to extend the grouped organization/repository format, currently used for lifetime summaries, to day, week, and month summaries for improved readability ([#200](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/200)).
