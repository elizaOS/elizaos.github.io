# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jun 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing user profiles with wallet linking features, introducing a visual indicator for linked wallets, and addressing issues related to data fetching and documentation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### User Profile Enhancements
- A gold checkmark icon is now displayed next to usernames on profile pages for users who have linked their Ethereum or Solana wallets, improving visual recognition of verified linked accounts ([#124](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/124)).
- This feature involved adding a new `GoldCheckmarkIcon.tsx` component and modifications across various profile-related files in `src/app/profile` and `src/lib/walletLinking`.

### Data Fetching and Pipeline Optimization
- An issue was identified regarding wallet address fetching occurring during the NextJS build process instead of within the pipelines workflow, leading to a new issue to move this logic ([#130](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/130)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation Updates
- A new documentation task was created and immediately closed, emphasizing that any code fetching data from GitHub or external APIs and storing it in the database should exclusively run within the pipelines ([#131](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/131)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Data Fetching Refactoring
- A new issue was opened to move wallet address fetching from the NextJS build process to the pipelines, as the current caching logic is not ideal and should align with other GitHub data fetching within the pipelines workflow ([#130](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/130)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Character File Import Issues
- Discussion continued on an issue regarding fresh installations of v1.0.11 failing to add character JSON files via the local UI ([#5228](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5228)).
- The latest comments suggest that the issue stems from changes in the expected format for `messageExamples` within character files, specifically requiring "user" to be changed to "name".
- Users also noted that `modelProvider`, `clients`, and `lore` sections might no longer be necessary or are causing issues, and removing them resolved import problems for some.
