# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Dec 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today saw significant progress with the addition of an RSS feed, major improvements to fork-friendliness, and essential dependency updates.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Content Syndication with RSS Feed
A new RSS 2.0 feed endpoint (`/rss.xml`) was added, providing daily, weekly, and monthly summaries of contributor activity. This feature includes proper XML escaping, markdown stripping for clean descriptions, and a new RSS button in the navigation header. ([#172](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/172), [#178](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/178), [#175](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/175))

### Improved Fork-Friendliness and Configuration
All hardcoded fork-specific values were replaced with environment variables, enabling smoother fork syncing without conflicts. The deployment workflow now auto-detects `BASE_PATH` and `SITE_URL` based on the repository name. ([#180](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/180), [#178](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/178))

### Pipeline and Sorting Fixes
The RSS feed item sorting was corrected to be chronological, and the pipeline workflow step ordering was fixed to ensure overall summaries run after repository summaries. The `SITE_URL` environment variable was also added for RSS feed generation. ([#177](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/177), [#175](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/175))

### AI SDK Updates
The OpenAI and Anthropic AI SDK dependencies were updated to their latest versions, including `openai` to 6.10.0 and `@anthropic-ai/sdk` to 0.71.2, which involved response type updates. ([#170](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/170))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#179](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/179) feat: make all fork-specific values configurable via env vars: This PR aims to replace hardcoded fork-specific values with environment variables for better configurability and easier syncing.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Enhancements for Fork-Friendly Deployments
The project addressed the need for more fork-friendly deployments by making all fork-specific values configurable via environment variables, which helps organizations running custom forks. ([#171](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/171))

### Dependency Cleanup and Optimization
Ten unused dependencies were identified and removed to reduce bundle size and maintenance burden, improving the project's efficiency. ([#173](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/173))

### Next.js Upgrade Blocker Resolved
A critical RSC serialization error blocking Next.js upgrades was fixed, allowing for future updates to the framework. ([#176](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/176))

### Adaptive Rate Limiting Implemented
The adaptive rate limiting feature for multi-repo ingestion was successfully implemented and is now working in production, improving pipeline performance. ([#159](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/159))

## NEW ISSUES

### Leaderboard Search Improvement
A new feature request proposes upgrading the leaderboard search from simple string matching to fuzzy matching to enhance user experience. ([#174](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/174))
