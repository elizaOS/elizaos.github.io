## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Agent-to-Agent Communication Without Polling:** Discussion on [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5584) centered on enabling direct agent communication. A proposed solution involves an OpenAI-compatible `/api/openai/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, allowing synchronous communication between agents without polling. This endpoint would directly access agent runtimes, convert message formats, and support streaming, addressing the need for immediate responses between agents like a Blockchain Agent and a Support Agent.

*   **Custom Plugin Schema Migration Issues:** Issue [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5588) highlights problems with custom plugin schema migrations. The root cause was identified as the `DatabaseMigrationService` not being registered as a runtime service for plugins, leading to skipped migrations. Solutions proposed include ensuring proper plugin schema structure with explicit `schema` export, declaring dependencies on `@elizaos/plugin-sql`, and potentially manual database schema creation or server-level plugin registration as workarounds until the migration system fully supports agent-level migrations.

*   **Twitter Client Initialization Error:** The discussion on [#31](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/31) continues regarding Twitter plugin initialization failures. Users are still experiencing errors despite successful authentication, with a new error message indicating a failed query during memory insertion. This suggests a potential issue with how the Twitter plugin interacts with the memory storage, possibly related to data formatting or database constraints.
