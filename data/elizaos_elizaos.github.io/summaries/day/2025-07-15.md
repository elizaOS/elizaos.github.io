## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Twitter API Rate Limit Issues
Discussions continued regarding the "Failed to fetch Home timeline" issue, which is causing "Too Many Requests" errors due to Twitter API rate limits. Users are experiencing this even with the latest version (1.2.16) and with `search enabled` set to false. The conversation revolved around whether a paid Twitter API subscription (Basic tier, costing $200/month) would resolve the rate limit issues, with confirmation that it does work. A new question was raised about the specific rate limit for the $200/month tier. ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38))
