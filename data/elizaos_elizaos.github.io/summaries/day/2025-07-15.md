## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Twitter Timeline Fetching Issues
Discussions continued on [#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38) regarding "Failed to fetch Home timeline." Users are experiencing "Too Many Requests" errors despite being on the latest version (1.2.16) and having `search enabled` set to false. The conversation focused on Twitter API rate limits and subscription tiers. A user confirmed that the $200/month "Basic" tier (previously referred to as "PRO") works, implying that free or lower-tier subscriptions are likely hitting rate limits. The specific rate limit for the $200 tier for Twitter search was questioned.
