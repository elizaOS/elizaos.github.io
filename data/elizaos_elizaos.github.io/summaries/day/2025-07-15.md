## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Twitter API Rate Limit Issues
Discussions continued regarding the "Failed to fetch Home timeline" issue, specifically concerning "Too Many Requests" errors from the Twitter API. Users are experiencing rate limit issues even with `search enabled` set to false. The latest comments indicate that the $200/month "Basic" tier for Twitter API access seems to work, prompting a question about its specific rate limits. Previous suggestions to update to version 1.2.16 did not resolve the issue for some users. ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38))
