# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Monthly Report (June 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
June was a month of foundational infrastructure development, focused on scaling the project's data analysis capabilities. The most significant achievement was the architectural shift to a multi-repository data pipeline, enabling contributor scoring and activity aggregation across the entire ElizaOS ecosystem. This was complemented by a major overhaul of wallet address management, which was standardized, optimized with batched requests, and moved into the new pipeline. While this backend work progressed, the team also addressed several user-facing bugs in the CLI and plugin system, and began planning for future enhancements like a contributor badge system and aggregated cross-repository reporting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This month's work centered on creating a more robust and scalable data processing backend, alongside targeted user-facing improvements.

- **Multi-Repository Data Pipeline Architecture**
  - The project's data pipeline was significantly refactored to support data ingestion and analysis from multiple repositories. This foundational work involved updating the repository configuration (`repoconfig`) to manage multiple sources ([#109](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/109)) and enhancing the contributor scoring and summary generation pipelines to aggregate data across them ([#137](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/137)). To ensure the stability of these changes, a pull request was opened to add comprehensive unit tests for the new pipeline modules ([#138](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/138)).

- **Wallet Address & GitHub Data Management**
  - The system for handling user wallet addresses was completely re-engineered for standardization and performance. The project adopted the CAIP-2/10 standard for wallet addresses ([#128](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/128)) and moved the entire fetching process from the NextJS build into the data pipeline ([#130](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/130), [#132](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/132)). Ingestion speed was significantly improved by implementing batched GraphQL requests to mitigate GitHub rate limiting ([#134](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/134)). As part of this refactor, unnecessary wallet caching logic was removed ([#135](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/135)) and the `githubService` was deprecated in favor of a centralized `github.ts` class ([#132](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/132)).

- **User Profile & Deployment Enhancements**
  - On the frontend, user profiles were enhanced with a gold checkmark icon to visually indicate linked Ethereum or Solana wallets ([#124](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/124)).
  - Project reliability was improved by fixing a critical bug in the deployment workflow triggers ([#136](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/136)) and adding comprehensive documentation for GitHub Actions and the data pipeline architecture ([#129](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/129)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management in June focused on resolving plugin and CLI bugs while opening new issues for major architectural and feature enhancements.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **Plugin & Agent Core:** Several key bugs were resolved, including a callback issue preventing responses in `plugin-evm` ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5017)), an error related to `TEXT_EMBEDDING` caused by missing plugin configuration ([#5279](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5279)), and confusion around custom plugin development, which was clarified to require a response via either callback or return, but not both ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5260)).
  - **CLI & Data Fetching:** An issue preventing the CLI from updating correctly was closed with instructions for users ([#5198](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5198)), and the issue of fetching wallet addresses during the build process was resolved by the pipeline migration ([#130](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/130)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Future Initiatives:** The end of the month saw the creation of several strategic issues. These include implementing multi-repository summarization for project reports ([#139](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/139), [#141](https://github.comcom/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/141)) and introducing a gamified badge system to recognize contributor achievements ([#140](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/140)).
  - **Architectural Challenges:** A significant ongoing discussion revolves around user identity management ([#105](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/105)). The current use of GitHub usernames as primary keys causes "split personalities" when users change their names. A major rework to use internal GitHub IDs is being considered.
  - **Persistent Bugs:** Active issues include the Twitter plugin failing to post replies ([#29](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/29)) and a `request entity too large` error when saving large character files ([#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5268)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month was characterized by a strong feedback loop between users and maintainers in diagnosing and resolving bugs. Issues like [#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5017) (plugin callbacks) and [#5228](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5228) (character file imports) showed active discussion leading to fixes. The month concluded with forward-looking planning, as evidenced by the new issues for a badge system and multi-repo summaries, indicating a strategic vision for community engagement and project transparency. The ongoing discussion around user identity in [#105](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/105) highlights the community's engagement in tackling complex, long-term architectural challenges.
