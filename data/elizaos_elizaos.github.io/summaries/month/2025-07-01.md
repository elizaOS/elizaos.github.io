# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of significant architectural advancement and foundational improvements for ElizaOS. The core theme was enhancing scalability and modularity, highlighted by the successful implementation of multi-repository summarization and a corresponding frontend overhaul to support this new paradigm. Alongside these new features, a strong focus was placed on improving project health through the introduction of a comprehensive query testing suite and the removal of legacy code. Key discussions this month centered on improving the agent and plugin experience, with active problem-solving around agent-to-agent communication, plugin schema migrations, and persistent issues with the Twitter API integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on building a more robust, scalable, and maintainable framework.

-   **Multi-Repository Architecture**
    A major effort was completed to enable the framework to operate across multiple repositories. This involved implementing a new backend feature for multi-repository project summarization, providing a holistic view of project activity ([#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142)). This was complemented by a significant refactoring of the frontend architecture to support a multi-repository UI, preparing the project for a more scalable and modular user experience ([#143](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/143)).

-   **Code Quality and Maintenance**
    To improve long-term reliability, a new comprehensive testing suite was established for queries across various modules, including date utilities, matching logic, and scoring ([#144](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/144)). In a parallel effort to reduce technical debt, a cleanup was performed to remove outdated scripts and historical data from the repository, simplifying the project structure ([#145](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/145)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue tracking this month reflected both the completion of major features and ongoing challenges with core agent functionality and external integrations.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   The issue tracking the implementation of multi-repository summarization was closed, marking the successful delivery of this key feature ([#141](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/141)).
    -   An issue to "Build Zapper plugin" was closed as a duplicate, helping to clean up the project backlog ([#5600](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5600)).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Agent-to-Agent Communication:** A critical discussion in [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5584) focused on enabling direct, synchronous communication between agents. A proposed solution involves a new OpenAI-compatible endpoint, `/api/openai/v1/chat/completions`, which would eliminate the need for polling.
    -   **Plugin System Challenges:** Developers are facing issues with custom plugin schema migrations, as investigated in [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5588). The root cause was identified as the `DatabaseMigrationService` not being registered for plugins, leading to detailed workarounds and debugging steps being shared.
    -   **Twitter Integration Problems:** Multiple issues highlight persistent difficulties with the Twitter plugin. Discussions in [#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38) revolve around API rate limits, with users confirming that a paid subscription resolves the "Too Many Requests" errors. Meanwhile, issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/31) tracks a client initialization failure that persists for multiple users even after a supposed fix, preventing the agent from operating as expected.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was highly visible in the project's issue tracker this month. There was a strong feedback loop between user `@wtfsayo` and contributor `@claude`, who provided in-depth technical analysis and potential solutions for complex issues related to agent communication ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5584)) and plugin migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5588)). Furthermore, the Twitter-related issues ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/31), [#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38)) saw multiple community members such as `@yasir23` and `@joaoCarvalho1000` confirming shared problems, demonstrating active community engagement in diagnosing and reporting bugs.
