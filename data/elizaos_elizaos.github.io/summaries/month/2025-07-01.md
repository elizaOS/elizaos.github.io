# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
Development in mid-July centered on a significant enhancement to the platform's analytical capabilities with the introduction of multi-repository project summarization. This new feature provides a more holistic view of project progress by generating overall summaries that span across all repositories. While this core feature was successfully implemented, an ongoing investigation into Twitter API rate limits highlights a potential challenge for users relying on social data fetching, with community discussion pointing towards paid API tiers as a necessary solution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary focus of the period was on expanding the system's summarization features to operate across multiple repositories.

- **Multi-Repository Summarization Implemented**
  A major new feature was merged to enable the generation of comprehensive summaries across all project repositories ([#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142)). This foundational work involved significant updates to the summarization logic in `src/lib`, database schema migrations (`drizzle/`), and adjustments to the analysis pipeline configuration. Following the backend implementation, a new pull request ([#143](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/143)) was opened to begin work on the corresponding frontend components.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on closing out the planned summarization work and diagnosing an external dependency issue.

- **Closed Issues:** The issue tracking the need for multi-repository summarization ([#141](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/141)) was closed, confirming the successful delivery of this feature.

- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened during this period. Discussions continued on an active issue regarding Twitter timeline fetching failures ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38)). Users are reporting "Too Many Requests" errors, and the conversation indicates that Twitter's free or lower-tier API subscriptions are likely hitting rate limits. A user confirmed that the paid "Basic" tier resolves the problem, suggesting this external API limitation is a key factor for users of the feature.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both feature development and issue triage. The structured progression from backend implementation ([#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142)) to the immediate creation of a frontend task ([#143](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/143)) shows coordinated development. Additionally, community members actively engaged in troubleshooting the Twitter API rate limits in issue [#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38), sharing findings about API subscription tiers to help diagnose the root cause.
