# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Jan 11 - 17, 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week focused heavily on strengthening the project's underlying infrastructure through comprehensive dependency management and CI/CD optimizations. Significant effort was directed toward updating GitHub Actions and core libraries to their latest versions, ensuring a secure and stable foundation for the ElizaOS framework. Beyond maintenance, the team improved the platform's data presentation by refining summary formats and fixing UI rendering issues, while also resolving long-standing operational bottlenecks related to deployment and API rate limits.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### Infrastructure & CI/CD Optimization
A major push was made to modernize the repository's automation workflows. By updating core GitHub Actions, the project ensures better compatibility with GitHub's evolving environment and improved security for deployment pipelines.
*   Updated `actions/configure-pages` to v5 ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/191)).
*   Updated `actions/checkout` to v6 ([#190](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/190)).
*   Updated `actions/upload-pages-artifact` to v4 ([#189](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/189)).

### Core Dependency Updates
The team executed a wide-scale update of the project's dependency tree, targeting both runtime libraries and development tools to leverage performance improvements and new features.
*   **Database & UI:** Updated `drizzle-orm` to `0.45.1` and bumped `lucide-react` ([#201](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/201)).
*   **Frontend Frameworks:** Initiated updates for `react-markdown` (v10.1.0), `recharts` (v3.6.0), and `tailwind-merge` (v3.4.0) ([#209](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/209), [#204](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/204), [#211](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/211)).
*   **Type Safety & Linting:** Significant version bumps for `@types/node` (v25.0.6), `zod` (v4.3.5), and `eslint-config-next` (v16.1.1) ([#210](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/210), [#212](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/212), [#208](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/208)).

### UI/UX & Rendering Fixes
Work was undertaken to ensure that technical data and contributor profiles are displayed accurately and readably.
*   **Markdown Rendering:** A fix was introduced to correctly render markdown within the profile summary cards, ensuring contributor information is formatted as intended ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).
*   **Summary Formatting:** The project successfully extended the grouped organization/repository format to daily, weekly, and monthly summaries, providing a more cohesive view of activity across the ecosystem ([#200](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/200)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
The team cleared several operational hurdles this week, focusing on system robustness and documentation:
*   **Deployment & Scalability:** Resolved issues regarding deployment steps within new organizations ([#69](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/69)).
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implemented preemptive mitigations for API rate limit issues to ensure uninterrupted service and data fetching ([#73](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/73)).
*   **Reporting Enhancements:** Finalized the transition to a more readable, grouped format for all summary types ([#200](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/200)).

### New & Active Issues
While no high-activity "hot" issues (3+ comments) were flagged this week, the influx of dependency-related pull requests indicates an ongoing effort to stabilize the project against recent major version releases of upstream packages like `zod` and `eslint`.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week was characterized by high-velocity maintenance and internal housekeeping. The volume of dependency updates (PRs [#203](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/203) through [#212](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/212)) suggests a proactive approach by maintainers to keep the framework modern. The successful closure of deployment-related issues ([#69](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/69)) reflects a focus on improving the onboarding experience for new organizations joining the ElizaOS ecosystem.
