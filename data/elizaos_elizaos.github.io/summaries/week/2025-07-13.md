# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development was centered on a significant architectural enhancement: the introduction of multi-repository project summarization. The backend and data pipeline work for this feature was completed, enabling the platform to generate holistic summaries across all project repositories. While this core feature moved forward, with frontend work now underway, community discussion highlighted an ongoing challenge with Twitter API rate limits impacting timeline fetching for users on free or lower-tier plans.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Progress this period was focused on expanding the platform's analytical capabilities to provide a more comprehensive view of project activity.

- **Multi-Repository Summarization Framework:** A major new feature was implemented to generate overall project summaries that span multiple repositories. The backend implementation ([#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142)) involved significant updates to the data schema, pipeline configuration, and summarization logic. Following the completion of the backend work, a new pull request ([#143](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/143)) was opened to begin building the corresponding frontend components.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of a key feature request and continued investigation into an external dependency problem.

- **Closed Issues:** The planned work for multi-repository summarization was officially completed with the closing of issue [#141](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/141).

- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. However, significant discussion continued in issue [#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38) regarding failures to fetch Twitter timelines. The conversation suggests that users are encountering "Too Many Requests" errors due to Twitter's API rate limits. A user confirmed that upgrading to the paid "Basic" API tier ($200/month) resolves the issue, indicating that free or lower-tier subscriptions are the likely cause of the problem.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both feature development and community support. The work on multi-repository summarization showed a clear progression from a closed issue ([#141](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/141)) to a merged backend PR ([#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142)) and a subsequent frontend PR ([#143](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/143)). Additionally, the active discussion in issue [#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38) demonstrates collaborative troubleshooting among users to diagnose the root cause of the Twitter API errors.
