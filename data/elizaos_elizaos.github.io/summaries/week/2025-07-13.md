# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by significant foundational progress, centered on the end-to-end implementation of multi-repository support. Development began with the backend and pipeline logic for cross-repository summarization and concluded with a major frontend refactor to support the new feature. Alongside this, the team invested heavily in improving code quality through a comprehensive expansion of the test suite and a cleanup of legacy scripts. Discussions on active issues highlighted key architectural challenges and future work related to agent-to-agent communication and plugin stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on delivering a major new feature while simultaneously improving the project's long-term health and reliability.

- **Multi-Repository Functionality Implemented:** A major effort was completed to allow the platform to handle multiple repositories. The backend was enhanced to generate overall project summaries spanning all repositories, including database schema migrations and pipeline updates ([#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142)). This was followed by a significant frontend architecture overhaul to support the multi-repository UI, preparing the application for a more scalable interface ([#143](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/143)).

- **Comprehensive Test Suite Expansion:** To bolster code reliability, a robust testing framework was established for queries and various utility functions. New tests were added for date utilities, matching logic, pipeline helpers, and scoring queries, ensuring greater stability and maintainability ([#144](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/144)).

- **Legacy Code and Data Cleanup:** The project's codebase was streamlined through the removal of outdated analysis scripts, historical data files, and legacy Python code. This cleanup reduces technical debt and simplifies the repository ([#145](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/145)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of the primary feature development task while surfacing important discussions about the core agent architecture and external integrations.

- **Closed Issues:** The main issue driving this week's development, **Multi Repo Summarization** ([#141](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/141)), was closed following the successful implementation of the feature. Additionally, an issue regarding a Zapper plugin ([#5600](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5600)) was closed as a duplicate.

- **New & Active Issues:** Discussions this week centered on several key areas:
    - **Agent & Plugin Architecture:** A significant discussion emerged around enabling direct, synchronous **agent-to-agent communication** without polling via a new API endpoint ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5584)). Another critical issue involves **custom plugin schema migrations** failing because the migration service isn't registered correctly for plugins, pointing to a need for architectural improvements ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5588)).
    - **Twitter Plugin Instability:** Ongoing problems with the Twitter integration continue to be a focus. Discussions on [#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38) identified that API rate limits on lower-tier Twitter subscriptions are a likely cause of timeline fetching errors. Meanwhile, issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/31) points to a separate error during memory insertion after authentication, suggesting a potential data formatting or database interaction problem.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development activity this week demonstrated strong, focused collaboration. The progression of the multi-repository feature‚Äîfrom a backend implementation ([#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142)) to an immediate follow-up with a frontend PR ([#143](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/143))‚Äîshowcases effective coordination. Furthermore, the detailed discussions in active issues, particularly around agent communication ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5584)) and plugin migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5588)), reflect a community deeply engaged in solving complex architectural challenges that are central to the ElizaOS mission.
