# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was defined by significant architectural advancements aimed at enhancing the project's scalability and analytical capabilities. The core achievement was the implementation of multi-repository support, beginning with backend summarization and followed by a major frontend overhaul to accommodate this change. Alongside this feature work, the team invested in long-term project health by establishing a comprehensive query testing framework and cleaning up legacy code. Persistent challenges remain in community-driven discussions around external API integrations, particularly with Twitter, and core framework mechanics like agent-to-agent communication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on foundational improvements to the project's architecture and testing infrastructure.

- **Multi-Repository Architecture Overhaul:** A major effort was completed to enable the framework to operate across multiple repositories. This began with the implementation of multi-repository project summarization, allowing for holistic analysis across the entire ElizaOS ecosystem ([#142]). This was followed by a corresponding refactor of the frontend, updating application components, queries, and utilities to support a multi-repository UI ([#143]).

- **Improved Testing and Maintenance:** To bolster code reliability, a comprehensive testing suite was set up for queries across various modules, including pipelines, scoring, and date utilities ([#144]). In a parallel effort to reduce technical debt, a significant cleanup was performed to remove outdated scripts and historical data from the repository ([#145]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Discussions this week centered on resolving complex integration and framework-level challenges, while key feature-related issues were closed.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - The primary issue for implementing multi-repository summarization was closed, marking the completion of this significant feature ([#141]).
  - An issue to "Build Zapper plugin" was closed as a duplicate ([#5600]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Twitter API Integration:** Two active issues highlight ongoing difficulties with the Twitter plugin. Users continue to report "Too Many Requests" errors even with search disabled, prompting discussion on the rate limits of paid API tiers ([#38]). Separately, users are experiencing client initialization failures despite successful authentication, with subsequent reports of database insertion errors after a partial fix ([#31]).
  - **Core Framework Mechanics:** Deep discussions occurred around core agent functionality. A proposed solution for direct agent-to-agent communication involves a new OpenAI-compatible endpoint to bypass polling ([#5584]). Another critical discussion addressed failures in custom plugin schema migrations, with analysis pointing to the `DatabaseMigrationService` not being registered correctly for plugins and several workarounds being proposed ([#5588]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week saw strong collaborative problem-solving, particularly within active issues. Contributor `@claude` provided in-depth technical analysis and proposed solutions for complex challenges like agent-to-agent communication ([#5584]) and plugin schema migrations ([#5588]), responding to requests from `@wtfsayo`. The persistent Twitter plugin issues ([#31], [#38]) have drawn engagement from multiple community members, including `@yasir23`, `@joaoCarvalho1000`, and `@RolandOne`, who are actively sharing experiences and debugging together. This pattern of detailed, solution-oriented discussion indicates a healthy and technically engaged contributor community.
