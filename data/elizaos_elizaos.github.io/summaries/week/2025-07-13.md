# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development was centered on a significant enhancement to the platform's analytical capabilities with the introduction of multi-repository project summarization. This new feature ([#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142)) provides a more holistic view of project progress by generating summaries that span across all configured repositories. While this major feature was successfully implemented, community discussion highlighted an ongoing challenge with Twitter API rate limits ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38)), indicating that paid subscription tiers may be necessary for reliable timeline fetching.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary focus was on expanding the summarization engine to handle multiple repositories, a key step towards providing comprehensive project insights.

- **Multi-Repository Summarization Backend:** A major new feature was implemented to generate overall summaries across all project repositories ([#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142)). This required extensive changes to the backend, including modifications to 16 files in `src/lib` for the new logic, database schema migrations (`drizzle/0011_silky_riptide.sql`), and updates to the analysis pipeline configuration (`cli/analyze-pipeline.ts`, `config/pipeline.config.ts`).
- **Multi-Repository Frontend Work Initiated:** Following the backend implementation, a new pull request ([#143](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/143)) was opened to begin work on the corresponding frontend components for the multi-repository features.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week directly reflected the development focus on summarization, while also addressing external service limitations.

- **Closed Issues:** The issue tracking the need for multi-repository summarization ([#141](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/141)) was closed, confirming the successful delivery of the backend functionality.
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. However, significant discussion continued on the active issue regarding failures to fetch Twitter timelines ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38)). Users are reporting "Too Many Requests" errors, and the conversation suggests that the free or lower-tier Twitter API subscriptions are hitting rate limits. A user confirmed that the paid "Basic" tier ($200/month) resolves the issue, pointing to a potential blocker for users not on a paid plan.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in both feature development and community support. The rapid follow-up PR for the multi-repo frontend ([#143](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/143)) after the backend work was merged suggests coordinated effort. Additionally, the active discussion on the Twitter API issue ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38)) shows community members actively engaging in troubleshooting and sharing findings to help diagnose the problem.
