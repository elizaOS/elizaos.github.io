# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development was centered on a major enhancement to the platform's analytical capabilities. The core achievement was the implementation of multi-repository project summarization, a new feature that provides a holistic view of progress across all project repositories. While the backend for this feature was successfully merged, work has already begun on the corresponding frontend. Separately, an ongoing community discussion has been focused on troubleshooting Twitter API rate limits, identifying subscription tiers as the likely cause of timeline fetching errors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
### Multi-Repository Summarization Framework
A significant new feature was introduced to generate overall summaries that span multiple repositories, fulfilling a key requirement for comprehensive project analysis.
- The backend logic, database schema migrations, and pipeline configuration for multi-repository summarization were implemented and merged in PR [#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142). This involved extensive changes to `src/lib` files, `drizzle/meta`, and `config/pipeline.config.ts`.
- Following the backend implementation, a new pull request ([#143](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/143)) was opened to begin work on the frontend components for this feature.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
### Closed Issues
The primary issue resolved this week was directly related to the new summarization feature, marking a successful development cycle from issue to implementation.
- **Multi Repo Summarization** ([#141](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/141)) was closed following the merge of the backend implementation in PR [#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142).

### New & Active Issues
No new issues were opened this week. The main focus of discussion was on an existing issue related to external service integration.
- **Twitter Timeline Fetching Issues** ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38)): Discussions continued around "Too Many Requests" errors when fetching the Twitter timeline. The conversation suggests that users on free or lower-tier Twitter API subscriptions are hitting rate limits. A community member confirmed that the paid $200/month "Basic" tier resolves the issue, pointing toward API subscription levels as the root cause.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community collaboration was evident in the active discussion on issue [#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos/github.io/issues/38). Users are actively working together to diagnose the Twitter API rate limit problem, sharing their own experiences and findings regarding different subscription tiers to help isolate the cause.
