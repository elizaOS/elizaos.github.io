# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was defined by significant architectural advancements aimed at scaling the ElizaOS framework. The core focus was on enabling multi-repository support, with major work completed on both the backend summarization engine and the frontend architecture. This foundational effort was complemented by the introduction of a comprehensive testing suite for queries and a cleanup of legacy code. While development progressed on core features, community discussions highlighted persistent challenges with third-party integrations, particularly the Twitter API, and uncovered key areas for improvement in the plugin system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on building a more robust and scalable multi-repository system, alongside crucial improvements to code quality and maintainability.

- **Multi-Repository System Implementation:** A major push was made to support projects spanning multiple repositories.
    - The backend was enhanced with a new multi-repository summarization feature, allowing for the generation of holistic project summaries ([#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142)).
    - The frontend underwent a corresponding architectural overhaul to support a multi-repository user interface, preparing the project for a more modular UI ([#143](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/143)).

- **Foundational Code Quality Improvements:**
    - A comprehensive testing framework for queries was established, adding extensive test coverage for date utilities, matching logic, pipelines, and scoring to enhance code reliability ([#144](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/144)).
    - The codebase was streamlined through the removal of outdated scripts and historical data, reducing technical debt ([#145](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/145)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of a major feature ticket, while active discussions focused on agent communication, plugin architecture, and external API limitations.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - The primary issue closed was [#141](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/141), marking the successful implementation of the multi-repository summarization feature.
    - Issue [#5600](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5600) ("Build Zapper plugin") was closed as a duplicate.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened this week.
    - **Agent-to-Agent Communication ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5584)):** A significant discussion led to a proposed solution for direct, synchronous communication between agents. An OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`/api/openai/v1/chat/completions`) was implemented to allow message forwarding without the need for polling.
    - **Plugin Schema Migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5588)):** A critical issue was investigated where custom plugin database migrations are skipped. The root cause was identified as the `DatabaseMigrationService` not being registered for plugins at runtime. Workarounds and debugging steps were provided, highlighting a need for future architectural improvements.
    - **Twitter API Challenges ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38), [#31](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/31)):** Multiple users continue to report issues with the Twitter plugin, including "Too Many Requests" errors and client initialization failures. The conversation confirmed that a paid API plan resolves rate limits but leaves free-tier users blocked, posing a significant challenge for autonomous agent operation on Twitter.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was strong this week, with collaborative problem-solving evident in several key issue threads.
- In issues [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5584) and [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5588), contributors `@wtfsayo` and `@claude` worked together effectively to identify requirements, perform root cause analysis, and implement solutions for agent communication and plugin migrations.
- The ongoing Twitter API issues saw multiple users (@yasir23, @joaoCarvalho1000, @RolandOne, and others) sharing experiences and debugging information, demonstrating a collective effort to diagnose a persistent and complex external dependency problem.
