# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was defined by a significant architectural evolution towards multi-repository support, a core step in scaling the ElizaOS framework. Major work was completed on both the backend summarization logic and the frontend architecture to handle project-wide data. Alongside this feature development, the team focused on improving project health through the introduction of a comprehensive query testing suite and the removal of legacy code. Persistent challenges with Twitter API integration and plugin migrations remain key areas of community discussion and active problem-solving.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on foundational changes to support project scalability and improve code quality.

- **Multi-Repository Architecture Overhaul:** A major push was made to enable the framework to operate across multiple repositories.
    - The backend was updated with a new multi-repository summarization feature, allowing for the generation of overall project summaries instead of single-repository reports ([#142]).
    - The frontend architecture was refactored to support a multi-repository user interface, preparing the application for a more modular and scalable presentation of data ([#143]).

- **Improved Code Quality and Maintenance:** Efforts were made to enhance the project's long-term maintainability.
    - A comprehensive testing suite was established for queries across various modules, including pipelines, scoring, and date utilities, to improve code reliability ([#144]).
    - A significant cleanup was performed, removing outdated scripts and historical data files to reduce technical debt and simplify the project structure ([#145]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on resolving the multi-repo feature task while actively discussing complex integration and framework challenges.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - The primary issue for implementing multi-repository summarization was completed and closed ([#141]).
    - An issue regarding a Zapper plugin was closed as a duplicate ([#5600]).

- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened this week, but several critical discussions continued on existing ones.
    - **Twitter Plugin Instability:** Users continue to report significant problems with Twitter integration across two issues ([#31], [#38]). Key problems include API rate limit errors ("Too Many Requests") and client initialization failures, which persist despite attempted fixes. These issues appear to be blocking autonomous agent operations for some users.
    - **Agent-to-Agent Communication:** A core discussion ([#5584]) on enabling direct communication between agents led to a proposed solution: a new OpenAI-compatible API endpoint that would allow for synchronous messaging and bypass the need for polling.
    - **Plugin Schema Migrations:** A bug was identified where database migrations for custom plugins are skipped because the migration service is not registered correctly at the plugin level ([#5588]). The community has discussed the root cause and proposed several workarounds while a permanent fix is considered.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was highly visible in the active issues this week. The discussions around agent-to-agent communication ([#5584]) and plugin schema migrations ([#5588]) showed a strong problem-solving dynamic between contributors `@wtfsayo` and `@claude`, who worked together to identify needs, analyze root causes, and propose solutions. Furthermore, the ongoing Twitter integration issues ([#31], [#38]) have drawn input from numerous community members, including `@yasir23`, `@joaoCarvalho1000`, and `@RolandOne`, who are collectively debugging and sharing their findings.
