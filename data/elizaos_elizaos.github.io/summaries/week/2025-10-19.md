# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused on initiating new work rather than completing existing tasks. Key efforts were directed toward two distinct areas: performance and community engagement. A significant proposal for adaptive rate limiting was introduced to address performance bottlenecks in multi-repo ingestion. Concurrently, a new feature for a contributor badge system was proposed to enhance community recognition. Activity also resumed on a long-standing issue with the Twitter plugin, demonstrating ongoing community-led triage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
While no major pull requests were merged this week, development activity centered on proposing new features and performance enhancements through new pull requests.

- **Performance Optimization Proposal**
  A new pull request, [#160](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/160), was opened to introduce adaptive rate limiting. This change aims to optimize for low-volume conditions and improve the efficiency of data ingestion across multiple repositories.

- **New Community Feature Proposal**
  To foster contributor recognition, PR [#161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/161) was submitted. It proposes the implementation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a badge system to acknowledge contributor achievements.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week. Triage activity focused on defining a new performance challenge and reviving discussion on a previously stale bug.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Performance Bottleneck Identified:** A new issue, [#159](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/159), was created to formally track the need for faster multi-repo ingestion. It identifies static concurrency as the primary bottleneck and suggests adaptive rate limiting as a solution, directly complementing the work proposed in PR [#160](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/160).
  - **Twitter Plugin Bug Revisited:** Discussion resumed on issue [#4180](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/4180), which had been marked as stale. The issue concerns a `dyld` error with the Twitter space plugin, and recent comments indicate a renewed effort to diagnose the problem.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was evident in both proposing new community-centric features and tackling existing technical debt. The introduction of a contributor badge system proposal ([#161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/161)) highlights a focus on improving the contributor experience. Additionally, the re-engagement on the stale Twitter plugin issue ([#4180](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/4180)) shows the community's commitment to resolving persistent bugs through collaborative debugging.
