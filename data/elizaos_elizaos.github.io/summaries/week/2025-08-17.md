# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Aug 17 - 23, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This was a quiet week focused on forward-looking research rather than active development. No new code was merged, but strategic planning for future capabilities was initiated. The primary activity centered on opening a new research issue to explore the integration of on-chain attestations, signaling a potential new direction for enhancing the framework's Web3 features.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
There were no new features, bug fixes, or other code changes merged during this period. Development activity was paused as the team focused on planning.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The management of issues was the main focus of the week, with an emphasis on defining future work.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved or closed this week.

- **New & Active Issues:** A significant new issue was opened to guide future development:
    - **Attestation Integration Research ([#150](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/150)):** This issue kicks off an investigation into integrating attestations using systems like the Sign-in with Ethereum Attestation Service (SAS/EAS). The goal is to explore how these technologies can be leveraged within the ElizaOS framework, aligning with the project's core philosophy of decentralization.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community interaction was minimal this week. Activity was confined to the creation of a single issue for future research, with no significant discussion or collaborative development taking place in pull requests or active issues.
