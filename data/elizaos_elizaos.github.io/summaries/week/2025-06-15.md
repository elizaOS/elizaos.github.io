# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by significant foundational work on the project's data pipeline and infrastructure. Key efforts focused on enhancing scalability through multi-repository support and standardizing data handling by adopting CAIP-2/10 for wallet addresses. This backend refactoring was complemented by user-facing improvements, such as a new verification indicator for linked wallets on user profiles. The team also dedicated effort to improving documentation and actively triaging several complex issues related to the CLI, plugin behavior, and data fetching logic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on strengthening the core architecture and improving the user experience.

- **Data Pipeline & Infrastructure Refactoring:**
  A major refactor of the repository configuration (`repoconfig`) now enables the pipeline to ingest data from multiple repositories, a crucial step for scalability ([#109](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/109)). In parallel, the system's wallet address management was enhanced by adopting the CAIP-2/10 standard and moving fetching logic to a server-side build process to improve consistency and performance ([#128](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/128)).

- **User Profile Enhancements:**
  To provide clear visual verification, a gold checkmark icon is now displayed next to usernames for users who have linked an Ethereum or Solana wallet. This new feature improves user trust and recognition of verified accounts on profile pages ([#124](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/124)).

- **Documentation Improvements:**
  Comprehensive documentation was added for the GitHub Actions workflows and the data pipeline architecture. This work clarifies the project's infrastructure and development processes for current and future contributors ([#129](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/129)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on resolving bugs, clarifying development policies, and identifying necessary architectural refactors.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **CLI & Plugin Fixes:** A bug preventing the `plugin-evm` callback from reaching the user in chat was resolved ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5017)). An issue with the `elizaos update` command was also fixed, with users now advised to use `bun install -g` for updates ([#5198](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5198)).
  - **Data Fetching Policy:** A documentation issue was closed to establish a firm policy that all code fetching external data (e.g., from GitHub) must run exclusively within the data pipeline workflow, not the application build process ([#131](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/131)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Data Fetching Refactor:** A new issue was opened to move wallet address fetching from the NextJS build process into the data pipeline ([#130](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/130)). This aligns with the new policy and addresses suboptimal caching.
  - **Persistent Bugs:** Active discussion continues on a critical issue where the web client shows a version mismatch and spams the GitHub API, causing errors and high memory use ([#4924](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/4924)). Another ongoing issue involves users experiencing failures when importing character JSON files, likely due to format changes in recent versions ([#5228](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5228)).
  - **Future Enhancements:** Significant progress was reported on allowing downstream projects to customize the root logger configuration, a long-standing feature request ([#5183](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5183)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the active troubleshooting seen in several issues. In [#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5017), contributors `jonathanprozzi` and `0xbbjoker` worked together to diagnose and confirm a fix for the plugin callback issue. Similarly, the discussion in [#5228](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5228) shows users helping each other identify breaking changes in character file formats. The project's development process also demonstrated a healthy feedback loop, with the identification of an architectural problem (wallet fetching location) immediately leading to the creation of a formal issue ([#130](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/130)) to track its resolution.
