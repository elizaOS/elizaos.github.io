# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development focused on enhancing both system performance and community engagement. A significant performance improvement was achieved with the implementation of adaptive rate limiting for GitHub API operations, ensuring efficiency during high-volume workloads. Concurrently, the project introduced a new MVP badge and achievement system, laying the groundwork for recognizing and rewarding contributor milestones.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this period centered on two key feature introductions aimed at improving core infrastructure and fostering community growth.

- **GitHub API Performance Optimization**
  To improve data ingestion and processing efficiency, adaptive rate limiting was implemented for GitHub API calls. This enhancement is designed to optimize performance for high-volume operations while adding no overhead to typical, low-volume workloads ([#160](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/160)).

- **New Contributor Badge System**
  A minimal viable product (MVP) for a contributor badge system was introduced to encourage community engagement. The system includes five badge types across three tiers (beginner, elite, legend) and was built with DRY and YAGNI principles to minimize code overhead while providing a new mechanism for contributor recognition ([#161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/161)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Based on the provided reports, there was no activity related to issues this week. No new issues were opened, and no existing issues were closed.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
While the reports did not indicate specific collaborative discussions, a primary development focus was on the community itself. The introduction of the new badge system ([#161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/161)) signals a direct investment in recognizing contributor achievements and fostering a more engaging community environment.
