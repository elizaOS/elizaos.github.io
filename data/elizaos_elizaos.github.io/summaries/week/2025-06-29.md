# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Jun 29 - 5, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity centered on planning for significant future enhancements and resolving existing bugs. While no new code was merged, the groundwork was laid for two major initiatives: a multi-repository summarization system to provide a unified view of project-wide progress, and a gamified badge framework to recognize contributor achievements. Key bug fixes were also completed, addressing issues with custom plugin development and a persistent startup crash on Windows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The focus this week was on planning and issue management rather than direct code contributions. No new features, bug fixes, or other code changes were merged into the repository.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management saw significant activity, with important bugs being closed and new feature requests opened to guide future development.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Plugin Development:** A bug preventing the creation of custom plugins for on-chain agents was resolved. The fix clarified that agent actions should use either a callback or a return value, but not both, to send responses ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5260)).
    - **Windows Stability:** Following community discussion confirming a fix was available, an issue causing `elizaos start` to crash on Windows was closed ([#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5161)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Enhanced Reporting:** Two related issues were opened to build a comprehensive, project-wide reporting system. The first proposes a "Multirepo Frontend" ([#139](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/139)), while the second details the backend logic for "Multi Repo Summarization" ([#141](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/141)).
    - **Contributor Gamification:** A new initiative was proposed to "Implement Badge System" ([#140](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/140)), aiming to gamify the contribution process and recognize community milestones. Initial art design for the badges is already underway.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Community engagement was evident in the active discussion around the Windows startup crash ([#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5161)), where user feedback was crucial to confirming the fix and closing the issue. Furthermore, the proposal of a new contributor badge system ([#140](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/140)) signals a strong focus on fostering a rewarding and collaborative environment for all contributors.
