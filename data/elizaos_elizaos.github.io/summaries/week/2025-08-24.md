# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's development efforts were focused on enhancing the project's data tracking and reporting infrastructure. The primary achievement was the expansion of repository monitoring to include the new `elizaos/docs` repository. In parallel, work was done to refine data accuracy by implementing exclusion rules for automated contributions from the Claude bot. This indicates a move towards improving the signal-to-noise ratio in our development activity metrics.
