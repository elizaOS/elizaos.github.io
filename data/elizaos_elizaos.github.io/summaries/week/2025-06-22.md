# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant overhaul of the project's data processing infrastructure. The contributor data pipeline was enhanced to support multi-repository aggregation, enabling a more holistic view of user contributions across the ElizaOS ecosystem. Development also focused on improving data ingestion efficiency, notably by implementing batched GraphQL requests for wallet addresses to mitigate rate limiting. Alongside these foundational improvements, the team addressed critical bugs in deployment workflows and agent plugin functionality, ensuring greater system stability and reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on scaling and hardening the core data pipelines and deployment processes.

- **Contributor Data Pipeline Overhaul:** A major effort was made to enhance the contributor data system. The pipelines were upgraded to aggregate user scores and summaries across multiple repositories, moving beyond a single-repo view ([#137](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/137)). This was supported by several optimizations, including a new pipeline for ingesting wallet addresses ([#132](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/132)), significantly faster ingestion speeds via batched requests ([#134](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/134)), and the removal of redundant wallet caching logic ([#135](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/135)). The `githubService` was also refactored into the main `github.ts` class to centralize data fetching logic ([#132](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/132)).

- **Deployment and Workflow Reliability:** A critical bug in the deployment workflow triggers was fixed, ensuring deployments initiate correctly ([#136](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/136)). To bolster the recent pipeline enhancements, a new pull request was opened to add comprehensive unit tests for key modules, aiming to improve long-term code reliability ([#138](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/138)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The team resolved critical bugs while also engaging in discussions on future architectural improvements and persistent plugin issues.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Plugin Configuration:** A "No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING" error was resolved by ensuring the required OpenAI plugin is included in the agent character file ([#5279](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5279)).
    - **Data Fetching Process:** The process of fetching wallet addresses was successfully migrated from the NextJS build process into the main data pipelines, resolving a key operational issue ([#130](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/130)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Scalability and Data Integrity:** Discussions are ongoing about significant architectural changes. One key topic is reworking user identity management to use internal GitHub IDs instead of usernames to prevent "split personality" profiles when users change their names ([#105](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/105)). Another discussion addresses the need to increase the file size limit for agent character files to prevent "request entity too large" errors ([#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5268)).
    - **Plugin Functionality:** Users continue to report challenges with custom plugins, where agents may stop processing after a single message ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5260)). The Twitter plugin is also facing issues with failing to post replies and incorrectly formatting newlines in responses ([#29](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/29), [#26](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/26)).
    - **API & Messaging:** There is positive movement on the proposal to use webhooks for initiating messages as an alternative to polling. Recent comments suggest this is feasible by having plugins mount routes to the ElizaOS server, paving the way for a more efficient messaging system ([#6](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development activity this week demonstrates a highly coordinated effort, particularly around the data pipeline refactor. The sequence of work‚Äîfrom implementing new ingestion methods ([#132](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/132), [#134](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/134)), to expanding functionality ([#137](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/137)), and finally to adding comprehensive tests ([#138](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/138])‚Äîsuggests a mature and methodical approach to development. Furthermore, active discussions on complex issues like user identity ([#105](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/105)) and API design ([#6](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6)) highlight engaged community participation in shaping the project's future architecture.
