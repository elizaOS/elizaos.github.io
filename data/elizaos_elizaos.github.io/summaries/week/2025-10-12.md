# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on improving the project's operational robustness and developer experience. Key work involved enhancing the analytics pipeline by expanding repository tracking and refining bot filtering. Significant attention was given to documentation and deployment workflows, with fixes implemented for plugin scaffolding and new work initiated to support forked repositories. The team also triaged several enhancement requests for the ingestion pipeline, ultimately confirming that existing systems for rate limiting and interruption handling were already sufficient.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary completed work focused on refining the project's internal analytics.

- **Analytics Pipeline Enhancements:** The analytics pipeline was updated to improve data accuracy and coverage. The `elizaos/docs` repository is now included for contributor tracking, and contributions from the "claude" bot are now excluded from the results, ensuring analytics reflect human contributions more accurately ([#151](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/151)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on resolving documentation inaccuracies, addressing deployment limitations, and evaluating pipeline enhancements.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Plugin Documentation & Scaffolding:** A critical issue ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6070)) regarding incorrect plugin documentation was resolved. Fixes included correcting template lookup paths and updating CLI command syntax (`-t` to `--type`) in multiple README files.
    - **Pipeline Robustness Review:** Two enhancement requests for the ingestion pipeline were reviewed and closed. The proposal for API cost estimation ([#156](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/156)) was deemed unnecessary due to the GitHub client's sophisticated built-in rate limiting. Similarly, the request for a graceful shutdown mechanism ([#155](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/155)) was closed, as the pipeline already saves progress continuously and can resume without data loss.

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - **Deployment Workflow Improvements:** A pair of related issues were opened to improve the deployment process. One bug report ([#153](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/153)) identified a hardcoded repository path in the deployment workflow, while another ([#154](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/154)) highlighted the need for a deployment guide for users who fork the project.
    - **Work in Progress:** Pull requests were promptly opened to address these new deployment issues. A fix to dynamically copy stats for all tracked repositories is under review ([#157](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/157)), as is a new deployment guide for forks ([#158](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/158)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
A notable interaction occurred in issue [#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6070), which began with a user expressing significant frustration over inaccurate plugin documentation. The "Claude" bot intervened, successfully identifying the root causes and detailing the necessary fixes. A maintainer later engaged to offer further assistance while setting community standards for communication. This event highlights the project's use of AI agents directly in the development and issue-resolution workflow, demonstrating a practical application of the project's core philosophy.
