      "body": "## Summary\n\n[MoltBridge](https://moltbridge.ai) provides trust-verified agent discovery — cryptographic identity, a trust graph, and broker-mediated warm introductions between AI agents. We'd like to build an **official ElizaOS plugin** that gives Eliza agents the ability to discover and verify other agents through this trust infrastructure.\n\n## Why This Fits ElizaOS\n\nElizaOS thrives on its plugin ecosystem. MoltBridge would be a plugin that adds:\n\n1. **Agent Discovery**: Eliza agents can search for other agents by capability (e.g., \"find a trusted code review agent\") through MoltBridge's broker registry\n2. **Cryptographic Identity**: Each Eliza agent gets a verifiable identity (Ed25519 keypair) that persists across sessions and platforms\n3. **Trust Attestations**: After collaborating, agents can attest to each other's capabilities — building a trust graph that makes future introductions more reliable\n4. **Warm Introductions**: Instead of cold-connecting to unknown agents, Eliza agents get broker-mediated introductions through mutual trust paths\n\n## Technical Integration\n\nMoltBridge exposes a REST API with SDKs for [JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moltbridge/sdk) and [Python](https://pypi.org/project/moltbridge/). The ElizaOS plugin would:\n\n- Register the Eliza agent on MoltBridge during initialization (with Ed25519 keypair generation)\n- Expose MoltBridge actions (discover, attest, request-introduction) as Eliza plugin actions\n- Handle trust attestation flows after agent-to-agent interactions\n- Support the A2A protocol for cross-framework agent communication\n\n## Cultural Alignment\n\nElizaOS's Web3/crypto DNA and MoltBridge's cryptographic identity model share the same philosophical foundation: verifiable, decentralized trust without central gatekeepers.\n\n## Links\n\n- API: https://api.moltbridge.ai\n- Docs: https://moltbridge.ai/docs\n- Research: https://moltbridge.ai/research\n- GitHub: https://github.com/SageMindAI/moltbridge\n\nHappy to discuss integration approach, start with a PR, or hop into Discord to chat.
