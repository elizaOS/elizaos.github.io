      "number": 6486,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "## Description\nWhen a user sends a message containing a URL, ElizaOS processes it twice:\n1. As text content → generates response\n2. As attachment (metadata/preview) → generates second response\n\nBoth responses are sent through the same SSE stream before the `done` event, resulting in duplicated text in the final response.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Start ElizaOS with webapp\n2. Send a message containing a URL (e.g., \"Check this: https://example.com\")\n3. Observe the response\n\n## Expected Behavior\nURL should be processed once, generating a single response.\n\n## Actual Behavior\nTwo identical (or near-identical) responses are generated and streamed as one message, doubling token usage and producing duplicated output.\n\n## Impact\n- 2x LLM API calls per message with URL\n- Doubled token costs\n- Poor UX with duplicated responses\n- Forces workarounds on client side\n\n## Environment\n- ElizaOS version: [your version]\n- Client: webapp\n\n## Suggested Fix\nEnsure URL is processed either as text OR as attachment, not both. The decision should happen in the message processing flow before LLM calls.\n",
