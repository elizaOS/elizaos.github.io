      "body": "# Add Verifiable Audit Trail Plugin (VAL)\n\n**Problem:**\nEliza agents need verifiable, tamper-proof records of their actions. Current logs are mutable and local-only - users must trust the agent operator.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\nAdd VAL (Verifiable Agent Log) plugin that automatically attests agent actions to immutable storage (Hedera HCS by default, works on any chain).\n\n**Example Usage:**\n```typescript\nimport { VALPlugin } from '@elizaos/plugin-val';\n\nconst agent = new Agent({\n  name: \"MyAgent\",\n  plugins: [\n    new VALPlugin({ topicId: \"0.0.12345\" })\n  ]\n});\n\n// Every action is now attested to HCS - immutable & publicly verifiable\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- **Trust**: Users can verify agent behavior independently\n- **Transparency**: Public audit trail of all actions\n- **Security**: Detect if agent behavior changes unexpectedly\n- **Compliance**: Auditable records for regulated use cases\n\n**Why This Fits Eliza's Philosophy:**\nEliza is about building agents \"in the open\" - VAL makes that transparency cryptographically verifiable. Every action is provable, not just claimed.\n\n**Specification:**\nhttps://github.com/aite550659-max/verifiable-agent-log\n\n**Reference Implementation:**\nhttps://github.com/aite550659-max/verifiable-agent-log/tree/main/integrations/eliza\n\n**Cost:** ~$0.0008 per attestation (~$30/year for 100 actions/day)\n\nWould love to contribute this as an official Eliza plugin. Thoughts?\n",
