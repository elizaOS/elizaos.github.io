      "body": "## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\nThe current OpenAI provider does **not support configuring a custom OpenAI endpoint URL**, which makes it impossible to use OpenAI-compatible third-party services (e.g., SiliconFlow). These services follow the OpenAI API format but require pointing to their own endpoint URLs instead of the official OpenAI endpoint.\n\n## Describe the solution you'd like\nAdd a **configurable `openai endpoint url` field/parameter** to the OpenAI provider, so users can manually specify the API endpoint URL when using OpenAI-compatible services.\n\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\n- Switching to a dedicated provider for SiliconFlow: Not ideal, as it breaks the unified OpenAI-compatible usage pattern.\n- Hardcoding the endpoint: Not flexible for different OpenAI-compatible providers.\n\n## Additional context\nMany cloud / inference providers (SiliconFlow, etc.) provide OpenAI-compatible APIs, only differing in the endpoint URL. Supporting custom endpoints will greatly improve the compatibility and flexibility of the OpenAI provider.",

      "title": "feat(scenarios): Enhance LLM Judge with multi-level evaluation",
      "author": "monilpat",
      "number": 5637,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "#### **Description**\n\nCurrently, the `llm_judge` evaluator provides a binary `PASS`/`FAIL` outcome. This is effective for clear-cut cases but doesn't capture the nuance of Large Language Model (LLM) responses, which can often be partially correct, contain good information but have poor formatting, or be conceptually right but incomplete.\n\nThis ticket proposes an enhancement to the `llm_judge` evaluator to support a multi-level evaluation scale (e.g., `FAIL`, `PARTIAL PASS`, `PASS`). This will enable more granular and realistic testing of LLM behavior, providing more insightful feedback on an agent's performance. It allows scenario creators to define what constitutes a full pass versus a partial one, leading to more sophisticated agent evaluations.\n\n#### **Acceptance Criteria**\n\n1.  The `LLMJudgeEvaluationSchema` in `packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts` is updated to allow the `expected` field to be an array of strings, representing the possible evaluation levels (e.g., `['FAIL', 'PARTIAL', 'PASS']`).\n2.  The `LLMJudgeEvaluator` in `packages/cli/src/scenarios/EvaluationEngine.ts` is refactored to instruct the LLM judge to respond with one of the provided evaluation levels.\n3.  The `EvaluationResult` interface is updated to include the specific `level` (e.g., 'PARTIAL') returned by an evaluator, in addition to the overall `success` boolean.\n4.  The `Reporter` class in `packages/cli/src/scenarios/Reporter.ts` is updated to display the evaluation level in its output, using distinct icons and colors for each level (e.g., ✅ PASS, 🟠 PARTIAL, ❌ FAIL).\n5.  The final `judgment` logic in `packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts` is enhanced to accommodate the new levels. For example, an `all_pass` strategy should require all evaluations to achieve the highest success level (e.g., 'PASS').\n6.  The process exit code logic remains `0` for an overall scenario pass and `1` for a fail, based on the final judgment.\n\n#### **Technical Approach**\n\n**1. Update Scenario Schema (`schema.ts`)**\n\nModify the `LLMJudgeEvaluationSchema` to accept an array of strings for the `expected` field. This array defines the custom evaluation scale for the judge. The system prompt for the LLM will be dynamically constructed from this array.\n\n```typescript\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\n// ...\nconst LLMJudgeEvaluationSchema = BaseEvaluationSchema.extend({\n  type: z.literal('llm_judge'),\n  prompt: z.string(),\n  // Change from z.string() to z.array(z.string()) to define the evaluation scale.\n  // Default to a binary scale if not provided.\n  expected: z.array(z.string()).optional().default(['FAIL', 'PASS']),\n});\n// ...\n```\n\n**2. Refactor Evaluation Engine (`EvaluationEngine.ts`)**\n\nThe `LLMJudgeEvaluator` must be updated to pass the new evaluation scale to the LLM. The general `EvaluationResult` type will also be updated to include the `level`.\n\n```typescript\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/EvaluationEngine.ts\n// ...\nexport interface EvaluationResult {\n    success: boolean; // True if not the lowest evaluation level\n    level: string;    // The specific outcome, e.g., 'PASS', 'FAIL', 'PARTIAL'\n    message: string;\n}\n\ninterface Evaluator {\n    // This method will now return the string level of the outcome.\n    evaluate(runtime: IAgentRuntime, result: ScenarioResult): Promise<string>;\n    getMessage(level: string): string;\n    // Helper to get the expected levels\n    getLevels(): string[];\n}\n\nclass LLMJudgeEvaluator implements Evaluator {\n    constructor(private prompt: string, private expected: string[]) {}\n\n    async evaluate(runtime: IAgentRuntime, result: ScenarioResult): Promise<string> {\n        const systemPrompt = `You are an AI assistant that judges the output of a command. Based on the prompt and the command output, respond with ONLY one of the following values: [${this.expected.join(', ')}].`;\n\n        const llmResult = await runtime.useModel('TEXT_LARGE', {\n            system: systemPrompt,\n            messages: [{\n                role: 'user',\n                content: `Prompt: ${this.prompt}\\nOutput: ${result.stdout}`\n            }]\n        });\n        \n        const response = llmResult.trim().toUpperCase();\n        // Validate the LLM's response against the expected levels.\n        if (this.expected.map(e => e.toUpperCase()).includes(response)) {\n            return response;\n        }\n        // Default to the first (lowest) level if the LLM's response is invalid.\n        return this.expected[0].toUpperCase();\n    }\n    \n    getLevels(): string[] {\n        return this.expected;\n    }\n    // ... getMessage remains similar ...\n}\n\nexport class EvaluationEngine {\n    // ...\n    async run(runtime: IAgentRuntime, result: ScenarioResult): Promise<EvaluationResult[]> {\n        const results: EvaluationResult[] = [];\n        for (const evaluator of this.evaluators) {\n            const level = await evaluator.evaluate(runtime, result);\n            const levels = evaluator.getLevels();\n            // \"Success\" is defined as any outcome that is not the lowest possible level.\n            const success = level !== levels[0].toUpperCase();\n            results.push({ success, level, message: evaluator.getMessage(level) });\n        }\n        return results;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**3. Enhance Reporter (`Reporter.ts`)**\n\nUpdate the reporter to handle and display the new evaluation levels with distinct formatting.\n\n```typescript\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/Reporter.ts\n// ...\n  public reportEvaluationResults(results: EvaluationResult[]) {\n    // ...\n    results.forEach(res => {\n      let status;\n      // Use a switch to handle different levels, with default for unknown levels.\n      switch(res.level.toUpperCase()) {\n        case 'PASS':\n          status = chalk.green('✅ PASS');\n          break;\n        case 'PARTIAL':\n        case 'PARTIAL PASS':\n          status = chalk.yellow('🟠 PARTIAL');\n          break;\n        case 'FAIL':\n        default:\n          status = chalk.red('❌ FAIL');\n          break;\n      }\n      console.log(`${status}: ${res.message}`);\n    });\n    // ...\n  }\n// ...\n```\n\n**4. Update Judgment Logic (`scenario.ts`)**\n\nThe logic for determining the final outcome must be updated to be aware of the different levels.\n\n```typescript\n// packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts\n// ...\n// --- JUDGMENT ---\nif (scenario.judgment?.pass?.all) {\n    // Strictest strategy: all evaluations must be the highest possible level.\n    finalStatus = evalResults.every(res => res.level === 'PASS'); // Assuming 'PASS' is the highest\n}\n// Potentially add new strategies here in the future, e.g., 'all_pass_or_partial'\n// ...\n```\n\n#### **Testing Strategy**\n\n1.  **Create a new scenario file**: `llm-judge-partial-pass.scenario.yaml`.\n2.  **Define a multi-level evaluation**:\n    ```yaml\n    # ...\n    evaluations:\n      - type: llm_judge\n        prompt: \"Respond with the capital of France in a complete sentence.\"\n        expected: ['FAIL', 'PARTIAL', 'PASS']\n    judgment:\n      pass:\n        all: true # This will require a 'PASS' result\n    ```\n3.  **Run with an input that yields a partial pass** (e.g., `input: \"echo 'Paris'\"`).\n    *   **Verify**: The reporter shows `🟠 PARTIAL`, the final status is `❌ FAIL`, and the exit code is `1`.\n4.  **Run with an input that yields a full pass** (e.g., `input: \"echo 'The capital of France is Paris.'\"`).\n    *   **Verify**: The reporter shows `✅ PASS`, the final status is `✅ PASS`, and the exit code is `0`.",

However, **the PR contains significantly more changes than described in the title and description**.\n\n## What's Actually in This PR\n\n### 1. Plugin-Bootstrap Fixes (Matches PR Description)\n- `actionState.ts`: Added type guards before `Object.entries()` on `result.values` and `workingMemory`\n- `relationships.ts`: Added null check in `formatMetadata()` to prevent crashes\n\n### 2. Major New Feature (Not Mentioned in PR Description)\n- **Request Context System**: New per-entity settings infrastructure for multi-tenant deployments\n  - Added `packages/core/src/request-context.ts` and `request-context.node.ts` (856+ lines)\n  - Modified `runtime.ts` `getSetting()` to check request context first\n  - Enables different users sharing the same runtime to have different API keys, OAuth tokens, etc.\n\n### 3. Message Service Changes (Not Mentioned in PR Description)\n- Refactored message creation logic in `message.ts`\n- Added `MESSAGE_SENT` event emission after sending to central server\n\n### 4. Version Bumps\n- All packages bumped to `1.7.3-alpha.3`\n\n## Concerns\n\nThe PR title says \"fix: Add null/undefined checks\" but this PR includes:\n- A major architectural feature (request context system)\n- Message service refactoring\n- 30 files changed, 1107 insertions, 52 deletions\n\n**This should have been split into separate PRs** for better review, testing, and rollback capability. The plugin-bootstrap fixes are straightforward and safe, but bundling them with a major new feature makes it difficult to:\n- Review each change independently\n- Test each feature in isolation\n- Roll back if issues arise with one component\n\n## Technical Review\n\nThe actual code changes are well-implemented:\n- Null checks are correctly placed and handle edge cases\n- Request context system follows AsyncLocalStorage patterns appropriately\n- Message service changes maintain event emission order\n\nThe plugin-bootstrap fixes will definitely prevent the `Object.entries` crashes described in the PR.\n\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\n\n- This PR contains well-implemented code but has significant scope creep beyond its stated purpose\n- Score of 3 reflects that while the code quality is good and the plugin-bootstrap fixes are safe, the PR includes undocumented major features (request context system, message service changes) that should have been separate PRs. This makes comprehensive testing difficult and increases risk. The PR description is misleading about the actual scope of changes.\n- Pay close attention to `packages/core/src/runtime.ts` and `packages/core/src/request-context.ts` as these introduce a new architectural pattern for per-entity settings that affects how settings are resolved throughout the system\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/actionState.ts | Added type guards for `result.values` and `workingMemory` before calling `Object.keys()` to prevent runtime errors when these values are null/undefined |\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/relationships.ts | Added null/undefined check in `formatMetadata()` to return `'{}'` when metadata is null/undefined instead of crashing on `Object.entries()` |\n| packages/core/src/runtime.ts | Added request context lookup in `getSetting()` for per-entity settings support - enables multi-tenant deployments with per-user API keys |\n| packages/server/src/services/message.ts | Refactored message creation to emit MESSAGE_SENT event after successfully sending to central server, improving event lifecycle tracking |\n| packages/core/src/request-context.ts | New file implementing request context system for per-entity settings in multi-tenant deployments |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant MessageService\n    participant Runtime\n    participant Provider\n    participant Database\n\n    Note over User,Database: Object.entries Error Flow (Before Fix)\n    User->>MessageService: Send message\n    MessageService->>Runtime: Process message\n    Runtime->>Provider: Get context (actionStateProvider)\n    Provider->>Provider: Access result.values (null)\n    Provider->>Provider: Object.entries(null) ❌\n    Provider-->>Runtime: CRASH\n\n    Note over User,Database: Fixed Flow (After This PR)\n    User->>MessageService: Send message\n    MessageService->>Runtime: Process message\n    Runtime->>Provider: Get context (actionStateProvider)\n    Provider->>Provider: Check if result.values is object\n    alt result.values is null/undefined\n        Provider->>Provider: Skip Object.entries\n    else result.values is valid object\n        Provider->>Provider: Object.entries(result.values) ✓\n    end\n    Provider-->>Runtime: Return formatted context\n    Runtime->>Runtime: Generate response\n    Runtime->>Database: Create memory\n    MessageService->>MessageService: Emit MESSAGE_SENT event\n    MessageService-->>User: Response delivered\n\n    Note over User,Database: Request Context Feature (New)\n    User->>Runtime: getSetting(key)\n    Runtime->>Runtime: Check request context\n    alt Entity-specific setting exists\n        Runtime-->>User: Return entity setting\n    else No entity setting\n        Runtime->>Runtime: Fall back to agent setting\n        Runtime-->>User: Return agent setting\n    end\n```\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<sub>(2/5) Greptile learns from your feedback when you react with thumbs up/down!</sub>\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
