      "author": "kunleulysses",
      "number": 4486,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "Environment:\nOS: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (on VPS)\nNode.js Version: v23.11.0 (installed via NVM)\npnpm Version: v9.15.0\nElizaOS Installation Method: Manual Monorepo Clone (git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git)\nElizaOS Version: Checked out to latest tag (Likely v0.25.9 based on agent package version in logs)\n\nKey Packages:\n@elizaos/agent: v0.25.9\n@elizaos/core: Likely v0.25.9 (based on agent)\n@elizaos/plugin-twitter: 0.25.6-alpha.1 (or version installed via @latest)\n@elizaos/plugin-anthropic: 1.0.0-alpha.0 (or version installed via @latest)\nHardware: VPS with 3GB RAM\n\nProblem Description:\nThe ElizaOS agent process successfully initializes its core components but hangs indefinitely immediately after the Direct Client REST API binds to its port (e.g., 3000). This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \"anthropic\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\nClean VPS environment.\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \"clients\": [\"twitter\"], \"plugins\": [\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\", \"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\"], \"modelProvider\": \"anthropic\", and a specific \"model\": \"claude-3-haiku-20240307\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\npnpm install\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\"characters/flappy.character.json\".\n\nExpected Result:\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\n\nActual Result:\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\n\n\n``` Relevant Logs:\n\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000. If running locally, access it at http://localhost:3000.\n# <-- HANGS HERE -->\n\nLog\nConfiguration:\n.env (Relevant Sections):\n# --- Twitter/X Configuration ---\nTWITTER_USERNAME=featherweightai\n# TWITTER_PASSWORD=********* # Masked\n# TWITTER_EMAIL=********* # Masked\n# TWITTER_API_KEY=********* # Masked\n# TWITTER_API_SECRET=********* # Masked\n# TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=********* # Masked\n# TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET=********* # Masked\nENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true\nENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true\n\n# --- Anthropic Configuration ---\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...#### # <<< IMPORTANT: Make sure this is correct\n# ANTHROPIC_API_URL=\n\n# --- Disabled Providers ---\nUSE_LOCAL_AI=false\nUSE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS=false\n# OPENAI_API_KEY=\n# GAIA_API_KEY=\n# ... etc other providers blank/commented ...\nUse code [with caution](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/13505487).\nDotenv\ncharacters/flappy.character.json (Relevant Sections):\n{\n  \"name\": \"Flappy\",\n  // ... Bio/Lore/Examples/Style ...\n  \"clients\": [\n    \"twitter\"\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\",\n    \"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\"\n  ],\n  \"modelProvider\": \"anthropic\", // Lowercase\n  \"model\": \"claude-3-haiku-20240307\",\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"secrets\": {},\n    \"twitter\": {\n      \"enable_replies\": true,\n      \"enable_timeline_search\": false,\n      \"enable_follow_thanks\": true,\n      \"enable_auto_retweet\": false\n    }\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n\nAdditional Context / Troubleshooting Steps Taken:\nIssue persists even after regenerating Twitter API keys/tokens and confirming \"Read, Write and access Direct Messages\" permissions are set correctly in the Twitter Dev Portal (OAuth 1.0a).\nIssue occurred similarly when trying to configure GAIA via Ollama settings (using plugin-local-ai, modelProvider: \"OLLAMA\"), hanging at the same point.\nRemoving both Twitter and AI plugins allowed the agent core to start without hanging (in previous testing phases), suggesting the issue occurs during plugin/client initialization after the core runtime is up.\nNetwork connectivity to api.anthropic.com was verified via curl from the VPS (connection succeeded, though curl syntax errors prevented full request validation).\nVPS has 3GB RAM, eliminating the previous RAM constraint issue encountered with local models.\nExplicitly adding the required plugins (plugin-twitter, plugin-anthropic) as dependencies to the @elizaos/agent package using pnpm add -F @elizaos/agent ... successfully resolved earlier \"Cannot find package\" errors during plugin loading.",
