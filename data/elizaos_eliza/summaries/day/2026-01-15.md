# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 15, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on critical bug fixes, including resolving an infinite rebuild loop in `dev-watch` mode and preventing shell environment variable leakage into agent secrets.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Preventing Infinite Rebuild Loops
An infinite rebuild loop in `dev-watch` mode was fixed. This issue was caused by `generate-version.ts` writing to `src/version.ts` on every build, which the watcher then detected, triggering endless rebuilds. The fix addresses this by modifying `packages/cli/src/scripts/generate-version.ts` and `scripts/dev-watch.js`. ([#6361](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6361))

### Enhancing Security by Preventing Environment Variable Leakage
A significant security improvement was implemented to prevent shell environment variables from leaking into ElizaOS plugin loading decisions and agent secrets. The `dotenv.config()` function was not overriding existing `process.env` values by default, leading to this vulnerability. This fix involved changes across multiple files in `packages/cli` and `packages/core`. ([#6360](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6360))
