# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, particularly addressing plugin loading issues and refining the migration to Bun's native EventTarget API for improved compatibility and performance. Significant progress was made in enhancing type safety and testing backward compatibility.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core API Modernization and Compatibility
*   Migrated from Node.js EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API, enhancing performance and compatibility with the Bun runtime ([#5609](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5609)).
*   Addressed critical review issues from the EventTarget migration, including type safety and method chaining support for `on()` methods ([#5614](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5614), [#5612](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5612)).
*   Replaced generic `any` types with `unknown` and explicit function signatures for improved type safety across the codebase ([#5611](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5611)).
*   Added comprehensive unit tests to ensure backward compatibility with EventEmitter-based patterns for the new EventTarget implementations ([#5613](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5613)).

### Plugin and CLI Stability Improvements
*   Fixed a critical bug preventing plugin actions from loading in the NPM deployed version of the ElizaOS CLI, ensuring proper functionality for published packages ([#5624](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5624)).
*   Removed the `node-fetch` dependency from the bootstrap plugin to ensure full compatibility with Bun's native fetch API, resolving issues with message sending in Bun environments ([#5607](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5607)).

### Documentation and Maintenance
*   Removed obsolete documentation files related to previously implemented fixes, streamlining the project's documentation ([#5621](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5621)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#5623](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5623) refactor(plugin-bootstrap): migrate JSON prompts to XML format: This PR proposes a refactoring to change the prompt format within the `plugin-bootstrap` from JSON to XML.
*   [#5622](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5622) feat: add tiny, dim CLI warning when running from monorepo: This PR introduces a subtle warning in the CLI when it detects that it's being run from within the monorepo structure.
*   [#5615](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5615) eliza: This PR is titled "eliza" and its purpose is not immediately clear from the title alone.
*   [#5610](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5610) chore: 1.2.11: This PR is a chore update, likely related to versioning or minor maintenance tasks.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### CLI and Agent Setup Issues
*   **Incorrect Directory Creation**: The `.elizadb` directory is being created in the current working directory instead of inside the newly created project folder when using `elizaos create` ([#5616](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5616)).
*   **Agent Unresponsiveness**: Agents created and set up are not responding to messages in the front-end GUI, specifically observed on Windows WSL ([#5617](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5617)).
*   **Windows Path Handling**: Windows CI tests are failing due to malformed file paths when running `elizaos agent start` with the `--path` flag ([#5619](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5619)).

### Plugin and General Inquiries
*   **Plugin-zapper**: A new issue titled "Plugin-zapper" has been opened, but no further details are provided ([#5620](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5620)).
*   **Test Issues**: Several issues with generic titles like "its working!" and "hello world" were opened and subsequently closed, suggesting they might have been test issues or quickly resolved queries ([#5625](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5625), [#5626](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5626), [#5627](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5627)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Twitter Integration Database Error
*   **Issue**: [#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39) "Twitter error with sql database"
*   **Summary**: This issue reports a `Failed query: insert into "memories"` error when starting the Twitter service, indicating a problem with database interaction for storing memories.
*   **Latest Comment**: A new comment from `yohaiai` at 2025-07-17T13:17:10Z simply states "+1", indicating that another user is experiencing the same issue or agrees with its importance. This suggests the problem persists and affects multiple users. Further investigation into the SQL insert query and database schema for "memories" is needed.
