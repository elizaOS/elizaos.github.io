# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Dec 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on significant code cleanup and refactoring, removing technical debt across various packages to improve code quality and maintainability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Extensive Codebase Cleanup and Refactoring
A substantial effort was made to remove "slop" from the codebase, including fixing `any` and `unknown` types, eliminating unnecessary `try-catch` blocks, removing sloppy comments, and deleting dead files and code. This cleanup touched numerous files across `api-client`, `cli`, and `app` packages, enhancing code clarity and reducing potential issues. ([#6213](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6213))
