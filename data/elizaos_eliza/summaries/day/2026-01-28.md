### N8N Workflow Engine Integration
Discussion on [#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429) continued with a detailed proposal for integrating the N8N workflow engine. The proposal outlines a `plugin-n8n` package with four main components: an N8N Service API client, Workflow Actions for agent capabilities, Context Providers for N8N nodes and workflows, and Task Workers for scheduled execution. Deliverables include the complete package, database schema, specific actions (CREATE_WORKFLOW, EXECUTE_WORKFLOW, LIST_WORKFLOWS, DELETE_WORKFLOW), providers, documentation, and tests. The contributor, spider-yamet, is seeking approval to implement this feature.
