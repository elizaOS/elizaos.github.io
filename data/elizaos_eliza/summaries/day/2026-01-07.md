# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 7, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, particularly addressing issues with `plugin-bootstrap` and `plugin-sql` related to server ID changes and PGLite compatibility. Several new issues were opened to optimize runtime initialization and database queries, alongside the closure of numerous UI/UX and agent management issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Plugin Bug Fixes and Compatibility
A significant bug fix was implemented in `plugin-bootstrap` to address issues arising from a `serverId` to `messageServerId` change, impacting actions and providers. Additionally, a minor fix was applied to `plugin-sql`'s schema. This resolves user reports of version 1.7.0 not working as expected.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Discord Plugin Publication Failure
Issue [#40](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/40) concerns the failure to publish Discord plugin version v1.3.4, leading to a jump to v1.3.5. The latest comment from `odilitime` on Jan 7, 2026, indicates that v1.3.6 was attempted but not published. Analysis of logs shows v1.3.3 as the last successfully published version on NPM. The comment details specific TypeScript errors encountered during publish attempts on Dec 23rd, related to type mismatches for `EventPayloadMap` and `DiscordRegisterCommandsPayload`, and issues with `params` being of type `unknown`. The `package.json` dependencies for `elizaos/config` (1.6.5) and `elizaos/^1.7.0` are also noted.
