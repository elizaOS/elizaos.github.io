## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Core Logging Fixes**
    *   Resolved a bug where streaming model calls (TEXT_SMALL, TEXT_LARGE) were not being logged to the database due to incorrect placement of logging code after a `return` statement in the streaming path, ensuring all LLM calls are now properly recorded.
