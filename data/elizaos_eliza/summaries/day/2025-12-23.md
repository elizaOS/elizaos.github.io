# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Dec 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing core functionality with generic type support for custom event handlers, improving code robustness. Several issues related to dashboard performance, agent builder refinements, and UI/UX improvements were closed, indicating significant progress in these areas.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Runtime Enhancements
A significant bug fix was implemented to add generic type support for custom event handlers in the core runtime. This allows plugins to define typed event payloads, improving type safety and developer experience.
- Generic type parameter added to `registerEvent` for custom events.
- Enables plugins to define typed event payloads extending `EventPayload`.
- Includes a new unit test to validate the functionality.
