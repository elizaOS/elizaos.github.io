## NEW ISSUES

### Core Processing Bug
A bug was reported where URLs in messages trigger duplicate LLM calls, processing them as both text and attachments, leading to two responses. An additional finding indicates two different prompts are sent for URL messages, confirming core-level duplicate processing.
- [#6486](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6486)

### Configuration & UI Enhancements
An error in the Renovate configuration requires immediate attention, as it will halt PRs. Separately, a UI enhancement request was made to add Discord as a messaging option on the Eliza App landing site.
