## CLOSED ISSUES

### Core Infrastructure & User Management
Several critical infrastructure issues were closed, enhancing user session isolation, memory persistence, and generic webhook services. This includes implementing isolated user sessions for multi-tenant architecture [#6409](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6409), ensuring Eliza remembers conversations and user preferences across sessions [#6411](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6411), and building a generic webhook service for stateless messaging plugins [#6430](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6430).

### Plugin & Integration Enhancements
Significant progress was made on plugin and integration capabilities, including dynamic plugin loading, calendar integration, and Microsoft OAuth. This involved configuring dynamic plugin loading based on user needs [#6403](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6403), enabling Eliza to manage Google Calendar events [#6405](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6405), and integrating Microsoft OAuth for Outlook calendar and email support [#6453](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6453).

### Agent Security & OAuth Management
Security and OAuth management for agents were addressed, with a focus on sandboxing and preventing duplicate OAuth connections. This includes setting up a security sandbox for the auto agent VPS and Twitter integration [#6434](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6434), and enforcing single OAuth connections per platform per user while linking Eliza App users to Cloud users [#6462](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6462).

## NEW ISSUES

### Critical Bug & Configuration Issues
A critical bug was reported regarding duplicate LLM calls when a URL is present in a message, and an action is required to fix the Renovate configuration.
- A URL in a message triggers duplicate LLM calls, processing it as both text and an attachment, leading to two responses [#6486](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6486).
- The Renovate configuration has an error that needs to be resolved, as it is preventing new pull requests [#6488](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6488).

### UI/UX Enhancements
A new UI enhancement request was made to add Discord as a messaging option on the landing site.
- Add Discord as a fourth messaging option on the Eliza App landing site, as it is currently only available on the get-started/sign-up page [#6487](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6487).
