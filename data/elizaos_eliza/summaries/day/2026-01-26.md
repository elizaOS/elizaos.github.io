# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 26, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw a critical bug fix in the `elizaos.js` import statement. There was also significant activity in issue creation, focusing on plugin integrations, research, infrastructure, and UX for the Eliza App, alongside the closure of several key issues including a blocker for AI Gateway credits.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
