## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Model Naming Convention Clarification
- **[#6390](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6390) Opus - pro and Ultra - sonnet? Is this right?**
  - The discussion clarifies that "Ultra" should correspond to "Opus" and "Pro" to "Sonnet," suggesting a swap in the current naming convention. This indicates a need for internal alignment on model terminology.
