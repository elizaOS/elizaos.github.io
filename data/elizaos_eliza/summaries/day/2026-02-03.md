## NEW ISSUES
*   **Performance and Runtime Optimization**
    *   An issue was opened to investigate and address significant latency (8+ seconds) during agent interaction, identifying cold start and encoding as root causes, not just provider delays ([#6450](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6450)).
    *   A critical bug was reported regarding the `Runtime getSetting()` function, where user settings fail to override agent settings, leading to API key issues on Eliza Cloud ([#6451](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6451)).
*   **Authentication and UI Enhancements**
    *   A task was created to record a demo video for Google OAuth verification, showcasing end-to-end functionality with Google Calendar/Gmail integration ([#6452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6452)).
    *   Integration of Microsoft OAuth for Outlook email and calendar support was proposed as an alternative to Google services ([#6453](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6453)).
    *   An issue was opened to revert previous authentication changes and restore the authentication page ([#6455](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6455)).
*   **New Plugin and MVP Launch**
    *   A new plugin, SOLPRISM, was proposed for verifiable AI reasoning on Solana, enabling agents to commit SHA-256 hashes of reasoning traces on-chain for tamper-proof accountability ([#6454](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6454)).
    *   A milestone issue was created for the Eliza App MVP launch, targeting the end of the week with a focus on a functional end-to-end user experience ([#6456](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6456)).
