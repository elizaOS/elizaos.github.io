## CLOSED ISSUES
### Messaging Plugin Integrations
The team successfully integrated the Telegram plugin into the Cloud infrastructure, allowing users to interact with Eliza via Telegram. Additionally, SMS/iMessage capabilities were set up for a native iOS messaging experience, fulfilling the goal of Eliza having a phone number. ([#6397](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6397), [#6399](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6399))

### Domain Acquisition
The eliza.app domain was successfully purchased and configured, with DNS pointing to the deployment and an active SSL certificate. ([#6419](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6419))

## NEW ISSUES
### Infrastructure and Database Improvements
New issues were opened to address critical infrastructure needs, including making a gateway for webhooks, reconstructing Cloud database migrations using Drizzle Kit to prevent developer time loss, and provisioning a second Blue.io phone number to separate development and production environments. ([#6442](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6442), [#6444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6444), [#6446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6446))

### Billing and Payment Systems
Discussions around billing led to new issues for implementing a credit/billing system for Eliza App users, including Stripe integration and credit warnings. A feature request was also created for a payment infrastructure plugin to enable agent-to-agent transactions. ([#6443](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6443), [#6445](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6445), [#6448](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6448))

### Agent Character and Prompt Engineering
An issue was created to improve Eliza's character file and prompts based on initial testing feedback, with a note from Boris highlighting the need for edits. ([#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6447))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Agent Character File & Prompt Engineering
Renator13 commented on [#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6447), suggesting that prompt engineering overhead is a "Biological Trap" and that agents should sync via logic, not prose, referencing MAE-1.0 and a BotNode.io blueprint for optimization.
