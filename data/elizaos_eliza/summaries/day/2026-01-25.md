### Project Generation Failure Discussion
The issue [#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388) saw active discussion. Initially, `standujar` inquired about the user's ElizaOS version and suggested using the latest (1.7.2). `Abdulkader-Safi` confirmed the issue persisted even after installation and provided an image. `standujar` then identified a broken wrapper and provided a temporary fix (`bun -i g @elizaos/cli`). `Abdulkader-Safi` confirmed the workaround was successful.
