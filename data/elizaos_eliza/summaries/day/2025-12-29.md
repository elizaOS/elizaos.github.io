## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Snapshot Eligibility and Wallet Connection
The issue [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211) regarding Snapshot Eligibility and Tangem Wallet Connection continues to be active. The latest comment from `om1d-sa` (a community member) provides two potential solutions for users facing migration issues: importing a cold wallet's seed phrase into a hot wallet like Phantom for migration, or seeking manual migration assistance through the official Discord server's ticket system, verifying support staff by their "ElizaLabz blue tag." This suggests ongoing community support and alternative solutions for users experiencing difficulties with the AI16Z → ElizaOS migration.
