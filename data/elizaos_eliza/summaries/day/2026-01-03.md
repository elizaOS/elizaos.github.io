# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 3, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on optimizing core message service provider handling for improved performance, alongside addressing new UI/UX issues and a SQL plugin fix.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Service Optimization
The `default-message-service` underwent refactoring to optimize provider handling in MultiStep mode, aiming for faster internal execution of providers without altering their functionality or results. This change primarily impacts the `core` package and is considered low risk. ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request was opened to fix an issue in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` for `SET LOCAL` to prevent parameterization problems. ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316))

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### User Interface and Experience
- A new issue highlights that the "Connect wallet" action should ideally lead directly to wallet options for a more streamlined user experience. ([#6317](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6317))
- Another issue reports that scrolling functionality should extend to the entire page for improved navigation. ([#6318](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6318))
