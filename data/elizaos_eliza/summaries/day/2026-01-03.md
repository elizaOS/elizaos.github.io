# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 3, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on optimizing core message service provider handling for improved performance, alongside addressing new UI/UX issues and a SQL plugin fix.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Service Optimization
A significant refactoring effort was completed to optimize provider handling within the `MultiStep` functionality of the default message service. This change aims to improve execution speed without altering the functionality or results of providers. ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316), was opened to address a fix in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` for `SET LOCAL` to prevent parameterization issues.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES

Issue [#6317](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6317) suggests that the "Connect wallet" action should directly present wallet options. Additionally, issue [#6318](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6318) highlights a problem where scrolling functionality is not working across the entire page.
