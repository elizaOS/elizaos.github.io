## OVERVIEW 
Today, development focused on optimizing build processes with a `turbo.json` update. A new draft PR for an RLM provider was opened, and a critical race condition bug in streaming endpoints was resolved. A new dashboard bug was also reported.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Build Process Optimization
- Optimized build task inputs in `turbo.json` to improve caching and reduce rebuilds ([#6349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6349)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A draft pull request, "[Draft] RLM provider prototype for Eliza Python core" ([#6383](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6383)), was opened, indicating early development on a new RLM provider for the Eliza Python core.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Critical Race Condition Fix
- The TOCTOU race condition in credit deduction for streaming endpoints was resolved by implementing a "deduct-before, reconcile-after" pattern ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Dashboard Usability
- A new bug was reported concerning dashboard navigation, where clicking outside a specific box does not return the user to the original window when attempting to create again ([#6382](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6382)).
