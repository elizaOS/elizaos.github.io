## NEW ISSUES

### Proposal for Verifiable Audit Trail Plugin (VAL)
Two new issues, [#6499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6499) and [#6500](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6500), were opened, both proposing the implementation of a Verifiable Audit Trail Plugin (VAL). The core problem identified is the current mutability and local-only nature of Eliza agent logs, which necessitates trust in the agent operator. The proposed solution aims to introduce a verifiable and tamper-proof record of agent actions.
