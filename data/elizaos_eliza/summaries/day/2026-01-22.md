## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **API Index and Contributor Profiles Export:**
    *   Issue [#225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/225) reported that API index and contributor profiles were not being exported due to a missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow, resulting in 404 errors on production.
    *   **Latest Comment (madjin):** The issue has been fixed by adding dynamic `SITE_URL` detection to `run-pipelines.yml`, using the same pattern as `deploy.yml`. This ensures that the correct site URL is determined based on the repository type (org sites or project sites), allowing `/api/index.json` and all contributor profiles to be generated correctly on the next pipeline run.
*   **Overall Summaries Generation for Inactive Days:**
    *   Issue [#226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/226) highlighted that overall summary API endpoints returned 404 for dates with no repository activity.
    *   **Latest Comment (madjin):** The issue has been fixed by modifying `generateOverallSummaryForInterval()` to always generate summaries, even when no repository activity exists. Instead of returning `null`, a simple fallback message "No activity recorded for [date]." is now generated. This ensures consistent API behavior, clear distinction between "pipeline hasn't run" vs "no activity", and honors the API contract for daily summaries.
