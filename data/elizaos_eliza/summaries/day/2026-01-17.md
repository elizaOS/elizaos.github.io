# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 17, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on addressing several bug fixes related to authentication, event emission, and plugin stability, alongside introducing a new core runtime method. Multiple new pull requests were opened, and one issue was closed after investigation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Runtime Enhancements
Two new pull requests introduce an `unregisterAction` method to the core runtime, enhancing flexibility in managing agent actions.
- [#6375](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6375)
- [#6372](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6372)

### Authentication and Environment Variable Handling
Several fixes were implemented to ensure proper loading of `.env` files in agent commands for authentication and to validate directory paths in CLI operations.
- [#6376](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6376)
- [#6374](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6374)
- [#6379](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6379)

### Plugin and Server Stability Improvements
Bug fixes were introduced to ensure entity connections before saving facts in the reflection evaluator and to correctly emit `MESSAGE_SENT` events after sending to the central server.
- [#6371](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6371)
- [#6370](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6370)

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Reflection Evaluator Behavior Clarified
Issue [#6364](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6364), concerning "Entity not found" errors in the reflection evaluator, was closed. It was determined that the behavior is "Working as Designed," as `ensureConnection()` is correctly called, and the "Entity not found" scenario occurs when an agent tries to create a relationship with an entity not present in the room, which is handled gracefully.

## NEW ISSUES

### Embedding and Database Inconsistencies
A new issue highlights a problem where the `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING` setting is not being respected, leading to the use of a 384-dim zero vector fallback while the database adapter expects a `dim_1536` column.
- [#6380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6380)

### Prompt Character Limit
A new issue has been opened to address the 500-character limit in the first application prompt.
- [#6381](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6381)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Discord Integration Error
Issue [#43](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/43) reports a `this.runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage' is undefined` error, indicating Discord is not working with the latest ElizaOS version. The latest comment suggests this issue is assumed fixed with a pending pull request in the `plugin-discord` repository, specifically when paired with `@elizaos/cli` version 1.7.1.
