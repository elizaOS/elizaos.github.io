### Plugin Selection User Experience Improvements
Two issues related to enhancing the user experience for plugin selection were closed today. This includes improving the visual feedback when a plugin is selected by using a full background color change instead of just corner highlights ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)). Additionally, a toggle selection mechanism for plugins was implemented, replacing the previous plus button with a tap-in/tap-out behavior ([#6236](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6236)).
