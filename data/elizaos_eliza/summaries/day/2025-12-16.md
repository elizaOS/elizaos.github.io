## CLOSED ISSUES
### Plugin Selection User Experience Improvements
Two issues were closed today, both focusing on enhancing the user experience for plugin selection. This includes improving the visual feedback when a plugin is selected by using a full background color change instead of just corner highlights ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)). Additionally, the selection mechanism was improved by implementing a toggle selection behavior for plugins, replacing the previous plus button functionality ([#6236](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6236)).
## NEW ISSUES
### Enhancements for Agent Creation and RAG
A new issue was opened to address the need for pre-uploading files during the initial agent creation process for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) knowledge, aiming to improve the overall UI/UX ([#6245](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6245)).
### Web Search Integration
