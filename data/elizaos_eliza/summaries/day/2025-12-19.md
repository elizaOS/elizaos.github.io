# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, particularly addressing issues with the bootstrap plugin and message formatting. Several UI/UX and performance-related issues were also closed, improving the overall user experience.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Bootstrap Plugin and Runtime Fixes
A significant bug fix was implemented to address issues within the `plugin-bootstrap` module. This included correcting changes in action/provider format and resolving an `initPromise` bug, making the `initPromise` accessible for plugins. This fix involved changes across multiple packages, including `core`, `plugin-bootstrap`, `plugin-quick-starter`, `plugin-starter`, `project-starter`, `project-tee-starter`, and `test-utils`. ([#6261](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6261))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### UI/UX and Performance Enhancements
Several issues related to user interface and experience were resolved. This includes fixing the voices page layout on MacBooks ([#6252](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6252)), removing a redundant container list header ([#6251](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6251)), and addressing a white flash during the login transition ([#6253](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6253)). Additionally, a fix was implemented for the sidebar hover effect ([#6254](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6254)) and the gallery tab refresh behavior ([#6256](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6256)). Performance improvements include investigating and resolving slow image loading in the gallery ([#6255](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6255)).

### Agent Builder and Markdown Improvements
Improvements were made to the Agent Builder experience, including optimizing model selection to use faster models for initial configuration steps ([#6185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6185)). The chat assistant was renamed to "Agent Builder" to avoid user confusion ([#6258](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6258)), and the ability to export JSON without deploying was added ([#6259](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6259)). Markdown rendering for bullet points in the agent builder chat was also fixed ([#6257](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6257)).

### Authentication Streamlining
The issue of redundant Privy re-authentication calls was addressed, consolidating multiple checks into a single authentication check per session ([#6249](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6249)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### JSON API Endpoints for Summaries
Issue [#185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/185), "feat: Add JSON API endpoints for summaries," was actively discussed and subsequently merged. The discussion focused on extending the static JSON API to include summary endpoints alongside existing leaderboard endpoints. Key points included generating JSON alongside markdown during the `summarize` command, accepting full exports due to manageable data volume, and keeping `export-summaries` as a backfill tool. The refined approach outlined an enhanced response shape for the API, including version, type, interval, date, generatedAt, sourceLastUpdated, contentFormat, contentHash, and entity details. Proposed endpoints included dated files and latest pointers for overall, repository, and contributor summaries, along with index files. The implementation strategy involved modifying existing summary generation scripts to write JSON and adding shared utilities for hashing, response building, and updating latest/index pointers, rather than a new CLI command. The issue was closed after being merged.
