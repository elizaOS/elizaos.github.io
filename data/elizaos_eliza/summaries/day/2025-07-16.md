## CLOSED ISSUES

### Character Migration Tool Released
The issue tracking the development of a v1 to v2 character migrator has been closed [#5452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5452). A dedicated character migrator tool is now available to assist users with the transition.

## NEW ISSUES

### Agent Creation and Directory Issues
Several new issues highlight problems with agent creation, particularly on Windows, due to directory creation failures and unexpected hoisting of the `.eliza` directory [#5603](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5603), [#5606](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5606).

### API Key Configuration Challenges
New issues indicate difficulties in creating projects without providing API keys, suggesting a need for optional API key setup during the `npx elizaos create` process [#5604](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5604), [#5605](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5605).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Agent-to-Agent Communication Without Polling
Discussion on [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584) centers on enabling direct message forwarding between agents without polling. A comprehensive solution has been proposed and implemented, introducing a new OpenAI-compatible `/api/openai/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. This endpoint facilitates synchronous, direct agent communication with features like streaming support and agent selection via `X-Agent-ID` header, aiming to eliminate polling and improve real-time interaction.

### Custom Plugin Schema Migration Issues
The ongoing discussion in [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588) addresses problems with custom plugin schema migrations. Analysis points to the `DatabaseMigrationService` not being registered as a runtime service and incorrect plugin schema integration patterns. Solutions proposed include proper plugin schema structuring, declaring plugin dependencies, and server-level plugin registration. Manual database schema creation or modifying server initialization are suggested workarounds.

### Twitter Client Initialization Error
Issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31) continues to receive comments regarding Twitter client initialization errors. Users are reporting persistent issues despite successful authentication, with recent comments indicating the problem persists even with updated plugin versions. The error message suggests a problem with inserting data into the "memories" table.
