# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Feb 6, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the dynamic execution engine with new tests for context management. Several new pull requests were opened to address null check issues in plugin-bootstrap and settings utilities. Additionally, two significant issues related to Discord plugin integration and deployment were closed, while new issues emerged concerning whitelisting, security audits, and EVM audit modules.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dynamic Execution Engine Testing
A new test was added to the V2.0.0 dynamic execution engine to validate context management, specifically to prevent context overflow. This work is a redo of a previous effort for the 2.0.0 release. ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Three new pull requests were opened today, all addressing null check issues:
- [#6473](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6473) aims to add a null check for `runtime.providers` in `plugin-bootstrap`.
- [#6471](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6471) focuses on adding null checks to `Object.entries` calls within settings utilities.
- [#6470](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6470) proposes adding null/undefined checks to prevent `Object.entries` errors in `plugin-bootstrap`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Discord Plugin Integration and Deployment
Two key issues related to the Discord plugin were successfully closed today. This includes the integration of the Discord Plugin into Cloud ([#6398](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6398)) and the deployment of Discord as an AWS Service ([#6424](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6424)). These closures indicate significant progress in enabling Discord as a messaging surface for ElizaOS agents.

## NEW ISSUES

### Access Control and Security Audits
New issues were opened today focusing on critical aspects of the platform:
- A comprehensive whitelisting system is proposed to control access to the game/gating system, including "First 100," Leaderboard, and Ad-Hoc Admin Controls. ([#6469](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6469))
- A security audit and fixes for the MCP implementation are required, based on findings from a recent review. ([#6472](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6472))

### EVM Module Enhancement
A request was made to add an EVM smart contract audit module to the ElizaOS EVM module, indicating a need for enhanced security features for smart contracts. ([#6468](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6468))
