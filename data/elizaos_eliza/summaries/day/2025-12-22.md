## NEW ISSUES

### Agent Builder UI/UX Enhancements
Several new issues were opened to refine the user interface and experience within the agent builder. These include moving the avatar button to a more prominent position ([#6273](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6273)), ensuring consistency for the "Create Agent" button across different views ([#6274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6274)), and refining the overall agent builder experience ([#6268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6268)). Additionally, there's a focus on improving the system prompt with a tooltip ([#6270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6270)), adding topics/adjectives to the agent form ([#6272](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6272)), and implementing an inline "send message" button ([#6271](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6271)).

### User Experience and Feedback
A new issue addresses the need for a warning when users attempt to leave the agent edit mode with unsaved changes ([#6275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6275)). Another issue highlights a user's concern about a "very long wait" for account recovery, exceeding the stated 72-hour timeframe ([#6267](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6267)).

### Agent Response Quality
An issue was created to focus on improving the smoothness of agent responses ([#6269](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6269)).
