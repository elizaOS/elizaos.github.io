# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 16, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the `elizaos/eliza` repository saw significant code refactoring in the `plugin-sql` package, enhancing maintainability and testability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### SQL Plugin Refactoring for Modularity
The `BaseDrizzleAdapter` in the `plugin-sql` package underwent a major refactor, extracting domain stores to improve maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns without altering the public API. This involved creating new domain store files for agents, cache, components, entities, logs, memory, messaging, participants, relationships, rooms, tasks, and worlds. ([#6366](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6366))
