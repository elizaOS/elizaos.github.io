# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 12, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant performance optimizations for runtime initialization, achieving up to 40% faster warm starts. A new feature was also added to allow configuring embedding dimensions, bypassing an expensive API call.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Runtime Performance Enhancements
Optimized `runtime.initialize()` by implementing atomic upserts and parallelizing independent operations, resulting in a 30% reduction in cold start times and a 40% reduction in warm start times. This involved changes across `plugin-sql`, `server`, and `core` packages. [#6342](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6342)

### Core Feature: Embedding Dimension Configuration
Added support for configuring the embedding dimension via the `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` setting, which eliminates a ~500ms embedding API call during agent initialization. This simplifies the `ensureEmbeddingDimension` method. [#6357](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6357)
