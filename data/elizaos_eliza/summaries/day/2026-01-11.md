## CLOSED ISSUES

### Performance and Database Optimization
Several issues related to performance and database interactions were closed. This includes optimizing runtime initialization by adding missing checks and removing redundant lookups, as well as exploring parallelization of independent operations [#6334](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6334). Additionally, efforts were made to implement UPSERT patterns for database queries, replacing check-then-insert operations with `onConflictDoNothing()` and optimizing `getEntitiesByIds()` to prevent cartesian products [#6335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6335).

### UI/UX and Agent Builder Improvements
Multiple user interface and user experience issues were addressed. This includes standardizing the size of display boxes [#6344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6344), resolving intermittent web search functionality problems [#6345](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6345), and implementing changes to the agent builder on mobile to default agent names to start with a capital letter [#6346](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6346).

### Content and Copy Updates
Updates were made to the textual content within the application. This involved implementing new copy for the agent edit interface [#6347](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6347) and the agent builder interface [#6348](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6348).
