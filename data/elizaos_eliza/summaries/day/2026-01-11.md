## CLOSED ISSUES

### Performance and Database Optimization
Several issues related to performance and database interactions were closed. This includes optimizing runtime initialization by adding missing checks and removing redundant lookups, and exploring parallelization for independent operations [#6334](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6334). Additionally, efforts were made to implement UPSERT patterns for database queries, replacing check-then-insert with `onConflictDoNothing()` and optimizing `getEntitiesByIds()` to avoid cartesian products [#6335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6335).

### UI/UX and Content Refinements
A series of user interface and experience issues were addressed. This includes standardizing the size of certain UI elements [#6344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6344), resolving intermittent web search functionality problems [#6345](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6345), and implementing default capitalization for agent names in the mobile agent builder [#6346](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6346). Furthermore, new copy was introduced for both the agent edit [#6347](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6347) and agent builder [#6348](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6348) sections.
