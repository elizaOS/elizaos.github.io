## TOP ISSUES

### Authentication Challenges
- Security concerns with API key management and authentication flows
- Need for more robust authentication middleware

### Plugin Architecture Limitations
- Bootstrap plugin dependencies causing unexpected behavior
- S3 storage plugin creating unnecessary overhead

### Performance Bottlenecks
- Large models being used for simple reply operations
- Inefficient object creation in Express routes

### API Integration Flexibility
- Limited customization options for embedding endpoints
- Need for better OpenAI plugin extensibility

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Authentication Enhancements
- Added comprehensive authentication middleware with API key dialog for unauthorized access [#4420](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4420)
- Improved security and user experience for authentication flows

### Plugin System Optimization

- Eliminated unnecessary Express object creation to improve server efficiency [#4414](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4414)

### API Integration Flexibility
- Extended OpenAI plugin to support custom embedding endpoints, enhancing adaptability [#4421](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4421)
- Improved client-side integration with updated API endpoints

### Client-Side Enhancements
- Significant updates to client components (10 changes)
- Improved CLI functionality with 4 key changes

## SUMMARY
May 2025 marked important progress in ElizaOS's development with significant improvements to authentication, plugin architecture, and performance optimization. The framework is now more secure, efficient, and flexible, particularly in how it handles API integrations and resource utilization. These changes align with our core philosophy of creating autonomous, adaptable, and modular AI agent systems.
