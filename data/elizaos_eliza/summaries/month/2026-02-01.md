# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (February 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
February was a pivotal month for ElizaOS, characterized by a transition from core infrastructure stabilization to the preparation for the Eliza App MVP launch. The project achieved significant milestones in multi-platform messaging integration (Telegram, Discord, and SMS), implemented a robust JWT-based authentication and user management system, and introduced advanced agent intelligence features like dynamic action filtering. Development also focused heavily on "Cloud-readiness," addressing multi-tenancy, database migration reliability with Drizzle Kit, and secure OAuth flows for third-party services. The month concluded with a forward-looking push toward a multi-language architecture supporting Rust, Python, and TypeScript.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### Authentication & User Management
A major overhaul of the security architecture was completed to support multi-entity environments.
*   **JWT Implementation:** Introduced a comprehensive JWT authentication system and user management framework, including support for external providers and data isolation ([#6200](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6200), [#6484](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6484)).
*   **OAuth Flows:** Implemented secure, chat-initiated OAuth flows for personal services like Gmail and GitHub ([#6410](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6410)) and recorded verification demos for Google OAuth ([#6452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6452)).

### Agent Intelligence & Core Optimization
Efforts were made to reduce latency and improve the "reasoning" efficiency of agents.
*   **Action Filtering:** Introduced the `ActionFilterService`, which uses vector search and BM25 reranking to dynamically filter actions, significantly reducing prompt bloat and improving LLM performance ([#6475](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6475)).
*   **Context Management:** Added new validation tests to the V2.0.0 dynamic execution engine to prevent context overflow ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)).
*   **Bootstrap Enhancements:** Optimized the `plugin-bootstrap` package for better type safety and performance, including a fix for a memory leak in the bootstrap cache ([#6476](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6476), [#6477](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6477)).

### Infrastructure & Messaging
The framework expanded its reach across several communication protocols.
*   **Multi-Platform Messaging:** Successfully integrated Telegram and Discord plugins into the Cloud infrastructure and established SMS/iMessage capabilities via Blue.io and Twilio fallback ([#6397](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6397), [#6398](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6398), [#6400](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6400)).
*   **Cloud Infrastructure:** Configured the `eliza.app` domain, reconstructed database migrations using Drizzle Kit to prevent developer time loss, and verified serverless multi-tenant support ([#6419](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6419), [#6444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6444), [#6415](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6415)).

### CLI & Developer Experience
*   **CLI Stability:** Fixed critical bugs in the CLI to ensure `@elizaos` dependencies always use the 'latest' version and improved `.env` file loading for remote server authentication ([#6362](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6362), [#6376](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6376)).
*   **Documentation:** Added comprehensive core documentation covering architecture, plugin development, and environment variables ([#6356](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6356), [#6483](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6483)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
*   **Event Handling:** Resolved a long-standing bug where the `MESSAGE_SENT` event was not emitting correctly when responses were sent to the central server ([#5216](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5216)).
*   **Settings Overrides:** Fixed a critical issue where user settings failed to override agent settings, which previously caused API key failures on Eliza Cloud ([#6451](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6451)).
*   **Plugin Latency:** Addressed a 3-second delay in MCP plugin initialization ([#6432](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6432)).

### New & Active Issues
*   **Performance Bottlenecks:** New reports identified significant interaction latency (8+ seconds) caused by cold starts and encoding issues ([#6450](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6450)).
*   **Security & Audits:** A security audit for the MCP implementation is pending ([#6472](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6472)), and a request was made for an EVM smart contract audit module ([#6468](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6468)).
*   **Billing Systems:** Discussions have begun regarding a Stripe-integrated credit/billing system for Eliza App users ([#6443](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6443)).
*   **Verifiable AI:** The "SOLPRISM" proposal suggests enabling agents to commit reasoning traces on-chain (Solana) for tamper-proof accountability ([#6454](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6454)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The month showed a high level of coordination around the **Eliza App MVP launch** ([#6456](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6456)), with contributors focusing on end-to-end user journeys and "bug bashing" sessions ([#6459](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6459)). There is an active philosophical debate regarding prompt engineering, with some contributors suggesting that agents should move away from "prose" toward logic-based syncing to avoid "biological traps" ([#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6447)). The introduction of a "Cost Evaluator" feature also saw community engagement to help users track LLM spending ([#5759](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5759)).
