# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December was a month of significant refinement and strategic planning for ElizaOS. Development focused on enhancing platform stability and user experience, with major efforts dedicated to server optimization, dependency updates, and a comprehensive UI/UX cleanup. A key theme was the tighter integration of ElizaOS Cloud, streamlining the CLI experience and setting the stage for future services. The month concluded with the opening of a large volume of issues that outline a clear roadmap for a major dashboard redesign and an improved user onboarding flow, signaling a strategic push to make agent and app creation more intuitive and accessible.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month spanned core infrastructure improvements, feature enhancements, and critical bug fixes.

- **Server Stability and Performance:** The month began with a major server-side refactoring to optimize the codebase ([#6199]). This was immediately followed by work to improve server reliability by addressing connection timeouts and implementing proper Socket.IO handling ([#6198]). Towards the middle of the month, a significant dependency update was completed across the entire monorepo, resolving version conflicts and ensuring ecosystem stability ([#6210]).

- **Core API & Framework Enhancements:** A unified API for serverless Node.js environments was introduced, streamlining core functionalities ([#6201]). In parallel, standalone examples were modernized to use the new `messageService.handleMessage()` API ([#6202]). Foundational work was also initiated for future capabilities, with pull requests opened to enhance streaming support for text generation ([#6212]) and a draft proposal for parallel action execution ([#6209]).

- **CLI & Cloud Integration:** The command-line interface was enhanced to make ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider, simplifying the setup process with a new browser-based login flow for API key configuration ([#6208]). Further integration work was proposed to add MCP + A2A service starters, tightening the link between the CLI and cloud services ([#6216]).

- **Plugin Improvements:** The `plugin-sql` received significant attention. An early fix improved directory handling for PGLite ([#6202]), and a more comprehensive update later in the month introduced a smooth migration path for older database schemas and optimized Row-Level Security (RLS) handling ([#6215]).

- **Bug Fixes & Code Quality:** A series of important fixes were merged, including improvements to markdown rendering in the client UI ([#6159], [#6197]), a critical fix for character secret encryption ([#6217]), and a comprehensive resolution for TypeScript build errors across numerous packages ([#6218]). A substantial code cleanup effort also removed technical debt, fixed types, and deleted dead code to improve overall maintainability ([#6213]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management this month was characterized by clearing a backlog of UI/UX tasks and defining a detailed plan for the next phase of development.

- **Closed Issues:** A large number of issues related to UI/UX enhancements were closed. These included simplifying the sidebar, improving the Agent Builder workflow ([#6173], [#6183]), fixing UI bugs ([#6186], [#6188]), and improving plugin selection feedback ([#6235], [#6236]). Other resolved issues included persisting landing page prompts ([#6181]), redirecting billing to Stripe ([#6184]), and clarifying documentation structure ([#6122]). The `plugin-sql` directory creation bug was also formally closed ([#6204]).

- **New & Active Issues:** The most significant event was the creation of over 20 new issues on December 15th, detailing a comprehensive redesign of the user experience. This includes plans for a new dashboard-centric landing experience ([#6222]), guided onboarding overlays ([#6221]), elevating "Apps" as a first-class product ([#6224]), and numerous granular improvements to agent creation and management ([#6226] - [#6243]). New feature requests were also opened for streaming support ([#6206]) and web search capabilities ([#6246]).
- Noteworthy active issues include user-reported difficulties with the AI16Z → ElizaOS migration, specifically concerning snapshot eligibility for Tangem wallet holders ([#6158], [#6211]). Additionally, a long-standing database error related to the Twitter plugin and PostgreSQL continues to see activity ([#39]).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this month appeared highly focused and coordinated. The large batch of detailed UI/UX issues opened on December 15th suggests a concerted planning effort by the core team to lay out a clear, actionable roadmap for the project's front-end evolution. Community engagement is evident through user-reported issues concerning wallet support and migration, indicating an active user base invested in the project's Web3 aspects. The presence of a pull request with a title in Spanish ([#6214]) also hints at the project's international contributor base.
