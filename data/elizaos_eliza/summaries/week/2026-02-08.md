# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Feb 8 - 14, 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week, ElizaOS made significant strides in enterprise-grade security and multi-language support, highlighted by the implementation of a comprehensive JWT authentication system and the announcement of a next-generation framework supporting Rust, Python, and TypeScript. Development focused heavily on core infrastructure robustness, specifically addressing user session isolation and memory persistence to ensure agents maintain context across interactions. The project also expanded its ecosystem through new onchain advertising capabilities and Microsoft OAuth integrations, while simultaneously optimizing agent intelligence via advanced action filtering.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### Core Infrastructure & Multi-Language Support
The framework is moving toward a more versatile architecture with the introduction of next-generation support for Rust and Python alongside TypeScript ([#6485](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6485)). To support this growth, logging efficiency was improved through a new non-blocking log buffering system with batch inserts ([#6492](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6492)).

### Authentication & Security
A major overhaul of the authentication layer was completed, introducing a comprehensive JWT management system.
*   **JWT Integration:** Support for external JWT providers and data isolation was added to bolster multi-entity security ([#6200](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6200), [#6484](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6484)).
*   **CLI Security:** The CLI was updated to load `.env` files for agent commands, enabling secure authentication with remote servers ([#6376](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6376), [#6481](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6481)).

### Agent Intelligence & Plugin Optimization
Efforts to reduce "prompt bloat" and improve agent responsiveness were central to this week's technical updates.
*   **Action Filtering:** The new `ActionFilterService` uses vector search and BM25 reranking to dynamically filter actions, ensuring only relevant data is sent to the LLM ([#6475](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6475)).
*   **Bootstrap Enhancements:** The `plugin-bootstrap` package received performance optimizations, better type safety, and a fix for a memory leak in the bootstrap cache ([#6476](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6476), [#6477](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6477)).

### Ecosystem & Integrations
*   **Onchain Advertising:** The `plugin-signet` was proposed to enable x402-based onchain advertising ([#6491](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6491)).
*   **Voice & Communication:** Integration documentation was added for ClawdTalk voice calling ([#6489](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6489)).
*   **OAuth:** Microsoft OAuth integration for Outlook and Email is now live, providing a robust alternative to Google-centric workflows ([#6453](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6453)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage

### Closed Issues
*   **User Session Management:** A cluster of issues ([#6409](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6409), [#6411](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6411), [#6434](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6434)) were resolved to ensure that each user interaction creates an isolated agent instance, preserving preferences and history across sessions.
*   **CLI Stability:** Fixed `ENOENT` errors by validating directory paths and ensured new projects use the 'latest' `@elizaos` dependencies to prevent installation failures ([#6362](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6362), [#6379](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6379)).

### New & Active Issues
*   **Duplicate Processing Bug:** A critical bug was identified where URLs in messages trigger duplicate LLM calls, as they are processed as both text and attachments ([#6486](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6486)).
*   **Vision/Image Stripping:** Issue [#6494](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6494) reports that image content is being stripped from LLM requests in cloud chat, specifically within the `/api/v1/chat/completions` endpoint.
*   **Custom Endpoints:** There is active discussion regarding support for custom OpenAI endpoint URLs ([#6490](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6490)). This would allow users to connect Eliza to OpenAI-compatible providers like Arko Studio.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The community is actively pushing for greater flexibility in model providers, as evidenced by the collaborative discussion on custom API base URLs. Documentation remains a priority, with new contributors or maintainers adding comprehensive guides for environment variables and server security ([#6483](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6483)). The introduction of the Rust and Python support indicates a strategic move to invite a broader range of developers into the ElizaOS ecosystem.
