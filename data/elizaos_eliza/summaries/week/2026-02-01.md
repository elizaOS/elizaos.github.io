# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Feb 1 - 7, 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week, ElizaOS focused on stabilizing the infrastructure and expanding the messaging capabilities of the Eliza App in preparation for its MVP launch. Significant milestones included the successful integration of Telegram, Discord, and SMS/iMessage plugins into the Cloud environment, alongside the acquisition of the `eliza.app` domain. The team also prioritized core system modularity through the introduction of `RequestContext` and addressed critical authentication and database migration hurdles. Development concluded with a shift toward the next release cycle (`v1.5.12-alpha.2`) and a focus on performance optimization to reduce agent interaction latency.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
The week saw a mix of core architectural enhancements and critical stability fixes aimed at improving the developer and end-user experience.

### Core System & Runtime Enhancements
- **Request Context Propagation:** Introduced `RequestContext` to the core system, allowing runtime methods to access per-user entity settings without explicit parameter passing, significantly improving modularity ([#6457](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6457)).
- **Dynamic Execution Engine:** Added comprehensive tests for the V2.0.0 engine to validate context management and prevent overflow using a schema-driven prompt execution path ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)).
- **LLM Evaluation:** Enhanced the `llm_judge` evaluator to support multi-level evaluation beyond binary pass/fail, enabling more nuanced response assessments ([#5637](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5637)).

### Messaging & Plugin Integrations
- **Multi-Platform Connectivity:** Successfully integrated and deployed the Discord plugin as an AWS service ([#6398](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6398), [#6424](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6424)) and established native iOS messaging via Blue.io ([#6399](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6399)).
- **Plugin Stability:** Addressed several null pointer exceptions in `plugin-bootstrap` and settings utilities to prevent crashes during provider initialization ([#6473](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6473), [#6471](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6471)).
- **ElevenLabs Integration:** Resolved API issues within the ElevenLabs plugin and avatar examples to consolidate project structure ([#6387](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6387)).

### Infrastructure & Documentation
- **Database Migration:** Reconstructed Cloud database migrations using Drizzle Kit to resolve manual script errors and prevent developer time loss ([#6444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6444)).
- **Documentation Overhaul:** Added extensive core documentation covering architecture, plugin development, interop, and API references ([#6356](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6356)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The project moved aggressively to close infrastructure blockers while identifying new performance and security requirements.

### Closed Issues
- **Authentication & Onboarding:** Implemented secure chat-initiated OAuth flows for services like Gmail and GitHub ([#6410](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6410)). The team also finalized the Eliza App landing page and "poke-style" onboarding flow ([#6412](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6412), [#6413](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6413)).
- **Event Handling:** Fixed a critical bug where the `MESSAGE_SENT` event was not emitted after agent responses reached the central server ([#5216](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5216)).
- **Settings Overrides:** Resolved a high-priority issue where user settings failed to override agent settings, which previously caused API key conflicts on Eliza Cloud ([#6451](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6451)).

### New & Active Issues
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** A new investigation was launched into 8+ second latencies during agent interactions, specifically targeting cold starts and encoding delays ([#6450](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6450)).
- **Security Audits:** Following a review of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation, a security audit and fix task was opened ([#6472](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6472)).
- **Verifiable AI:** A proposal for the "SOLPRISM" plugin was introduced to enable agents to commit reasoning traces to the Solana blockchain for tamper-proof accountability ([#6454](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6454)).
- **Cost Tracking:** Ongoing discussion persists regarding a "Cost Evaluator" feature to estimate LLM usage costs, with strong community consensus on its necessity ([#5759](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5759)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Collaboration this week was characterized by a push toward the Eliza App MVP. The team coordinated "bug bashing" sessions to ensure quality assurance across new integrations ([#6459](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6459)). Technical discourse was particularly active regarding agent character engineering, with contributors debating the "biological trap" of prose-based prompts versus logic-based synchronization. The opening of the "next" development branch ([#6474](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6474)) suggests a transition from infrastructure stabilization back to feature expansion.
