# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant push to modernize the core framework and enhance developer experience. Major progress was made in migrating core components to Bun-native APIs, such as the transition from Node.js EventEmitter to EventTarget, improving performance and type safety. The introduction of standardized service types marks a key step towards a more modular architecture. Concurrently, the team resolved numerous critical bugs in the CLI related to project creation, dependency management, and server stability. Finally, extensive planning was completed for a new "Scenario Runner" feature, laying the groundwork for advanced agent evaluation capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on strengthening the project's foundations, improving tooling, and enhancing the plugin ecosystem.

- **Core Framework Modernization:**
  - A major refactoring effort began to replace Node.js EventEmitter with Bun's native EventTarget API, aiming for better performance and runtime compatibility ([#5609](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5609)). Follow-up work ensured backward compatibility and improved type safety ([#5614](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5614), [#5613](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5613), [#5611](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5611)).
  - Standardized service types were implemented, allowing services to be retrieved by type via `getServicesByType()`, a foundational change for building more abstract and extensible plugins ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)).
  - The project continued its shift towards a Bun-centric environment by replacing `execa` with Bun's native process spawning for tests and removing `npm` references from the CLI ([#5556](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5556), [#5586](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5586), [#5599](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5599)).

- **CLI Stability and Developer Experience:**
  - Several critical bugs affecting the developer workflow were fixed, including an issue where the `tsup` build was wiping the `vite` build ([#5555](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5555]), and a fix to ensure the dev server shuts down gracefully with `Cmd+C` ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562]).
  - The `elizaos start` command now automatically builds the project, mirroring the `dev` command's behavior ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504]).
  - Project creation was made more robust by fixing bugs related to the placement of the `.elizadb` directory in nested projects ([#5618](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5618]).
  - The `dev` command now handles port conflicts by automatically finding the next available port ([#5592](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5592]).

- **Plugin Ecosystem and CI Enhancements:**
  - A new `plugin-quick-starter` template was added to streamline the development of backend-only plugins ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589]).
  - A critical bug was fixed that prevented plugin actions from loading in the NPM-deployed version of the CLI ([#5624](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5624]).
  - The Claude code review workflow was enhanced with full bash and GitHub CLI access, enabling more powerful automated reviews ([#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on resolving long-standing bugs, addressing new CLI issues, and planning for future features.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - A significant number of bugs related to the CLI and developer environment were resolved, including issues with the `start` command on Windows ([#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5161)), server shutdown ([#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559]), and incorrect directory creation ([#5606](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5606]).
  - The implementation of service types was officially completed ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914]), and a v1-to-v2 character migrator tool was released ([#5452](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/issues/5452)).
  - Several plugin-related problems were fixed, including installation issues ([#4861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4861]) and type errors ([#5518](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5518)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Scenario Runner:** A major new feature, the "Scenario Runner," was scoped out through a series of detailed issues ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573) - [#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579]), covering everything from the CLI command to YAML parsing, sandboxed execution, and evaluation.
  - **Agent Communication:** An active discussion on enabling direct agent-to-agent communication without polling ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584]) led to a comprehensive proposed solution involving a new OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.
  - **CLI Usability:** New issues were opened regarding CLI usability, particularly on Windows ([#5603](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5603), [#5619](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5619]), and a need to make API keys optional during project creation ([#5604](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5604)).
  - **Twitter Plugin:** The long-standing issues with the Twitter plugin continue to be active, with users reporting API rate limit errors ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38)) and database insertion failures ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week saw strong collaborative efforts in both planning and problem-solving. The detailed breakdown of the Scenario Runner feature into multiple, well-defined issues indicates a coordinated planning process to tackle a significant new development effort. Furthermore, active discussions around complex topics like agent-to-agent communication ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584]) and custom plugin schema migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588]) highlight the community's engagement in diagnosing and solving core architectural challenges. The creation of a new plugin starter template and a request for a Zapper plugin suggest a healthy and growing interest in extending the ElizaOS ecosystem.
