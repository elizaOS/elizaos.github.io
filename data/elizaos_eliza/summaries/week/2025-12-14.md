# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant strategic push to overhaul the platform's user experience, alongside critical backend maintenance. A massive influx of new issues laid out a comprehensive roadmap for redesigning the user dashboard, streamlining agent creation, and simplifying user onboarding. This planning effort was complemented by tangible progress, including crucial stability fixes for the `plugin-sql` migration process and the CLI's testing suite. The first results of the new UX initiative were also delivered, with improvements to the plugin selection interface being completed and closed.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week focused on enhancing the stability and reliability of core infrastructure components.

- **Plugin-SQL and Testing Infrastructure Fixes:**
  - The `plugin-sql` was significantly improved to ensure smooth, backward-compatible data migration from pre-1.6.5 versions, while also optimizing Row-Level Security (RLS) handling and overall SQL organization ([#6215](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6215)).
  - Failures in the `elizaos test` command were resolved by fixing an API signature mismatch in the CLI's end-to-end tests and correcting a mock function name in a unit test ([#6207](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6207)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The issue tracker saw a surge of activity, primarily focused on planning a major user experience enhancement initiative.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - As a first step in the broader UI/UX overhaul, two issues were closed to improve the agent creation process. The visual feedback for plugin selection was enhanced with a full background color change ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)), and the interaction was simplified by implementing a more intuitive tap-in/tap-out toggle behavior ([#6236](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6236)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - A large-scale planning effort resulted in dozens of new issues aimed at redefining the user journey. Key themes include:
    - **Dashboard & Onboarding Redesign:** A complete redesign of the dashboard as the primary landing experience ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)) and the implementation of guided onboarding overlays ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221]).
    - **Agent & App Management UX:** Numerous proposals to improve the agent creation flow, such as providing post-creation next steps ([#6226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6226)), clarifying button labels like "Save" to "Deploy" ([#6232](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6232)), and simplifying file management ([#6239](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/issues/6239)).
    - **Simplifying Terminology:** A conscious effort to make the platform more accessible by replacing technical jargon like "RAG" and "MCP" with plain language terms like "Files" and "Services" in the UI ([#6240](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6240), [#6241](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6241)).
  - New feature proposals include implementing web search capabilities ([#6246](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6246)) and creating a guide for AI agent payment implementation ([#6244](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6244)).

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The coordinated opening of a large volume of interconnected issues on December 15 suggests a highly focused strategic planning session by the core team. This indicates strong alignment on prioritizing a user-centric redesign of the platform. The rapid closure of two of these newly created UI issues the following day demonstrates an agile and responsive development cycle, quickly turning plans into tangible improvements.
