# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's efforts focused on strengthening the project's foundation and addressing critical dependency issues. A significant step was taken to improve long-term code health by introducing automated dependency management via Renovate. Concurrently, investigation continued into a key import error affecting users of a specific Eliza CLI version, highlighting a focus on ensuring stability and a smooth developer experience across the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month centered on improving development infrastructure and maintenance processes.

-   **Automated Dependency Management**
    To ensure the project remains secure and up-to-date with its dependencies, a Renovate configuration was introduced. This proactive measure, submitted in PR [#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/16), will automate the process of creating pull requests for dependency updates, reducing manual maintenance overhead.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management was focused on investigating a significant compatibility problem.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    No issues were closed during this period.

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    No new issues were opened. However, significant attention was given to the active issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031), which details module import errors for `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` when using Eliza CLI version 1.6.1. The investigation suggests the root cause may be incorrect type definition files within the `@Elizaos/core` package itself. The issue appears to be isolated to version 1.6.1, as downgrading to 1.5.15 or upgrading to a newer version resolves the problem.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Based on the available data, collaboration was centered on technical investigation. The ongoing discussion around issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031) indicates a collaborative effort to diagnose a core dependency problem impacting the plugin.
