# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Monthly Report (September 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
Development in September focused on enhancing the interactive capabilities of the Telegram plugin. The primary effort was centered on introducing support for inline keyboard callback buttons, a feature designed to expand the ways users can interact with AI agents. This work, initiated by a feature request, progressed directly to a pull request, demonstrating a focused effort to build more dynamic and responsive agent experiences within the Telegram ecosystem.
