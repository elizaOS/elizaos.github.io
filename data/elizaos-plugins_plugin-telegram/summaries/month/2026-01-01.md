# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Monthly Report (January 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
In January 2026, development for the Telegram plugin focused on identifying and triaging stability issues related to media handling. The primary theme of the month was the discovery of a critical regression in image processing that affects core bot functionality. While no major features were merged during this period, the identification of this flaw provides a clear roadmap for stabilizing the plugin's interaction with native Telegram client features.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
There were no completed technical developments or merged pull requests reported during this period. The project's technical focus remained on the diagnostic phase of existing bugs rather than the deployment of new features or refactors.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
The month's activity was centered on the identification of a significant stability blocker regarding how the plugin interacts with the Telegram API's media types.

### New & Active Issues
*   **Critical Image Processing Bug:** A high-priority issue was opened regarding a `TypeError` occurring within the `processImage` function ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/23)). This bug is triggered specifically when users upload images "as a photo" (using Telegram's native compression) rather than as a file. This represents a significant blocker for production environments, as it leads to immediate plugin instability and crashes during routine user interactions.

### Closed Issues
No issues were closed during this month.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
Community activity this month was focused on bug reporting and initial triage. The identification of issue [#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/23) indicates active monitoring of the plugin's performance in real-world scenarios. While no collaborative PR reviews took place, the reporting of critical flaws suggests a community-driven effort to maintain the robustness of the ElizaOS ecosystem's Telegram integration.
