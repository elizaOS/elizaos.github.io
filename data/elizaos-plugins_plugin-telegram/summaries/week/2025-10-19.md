# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts focused on enhancing the stability and debuggability of the Telegram plugin. A significant refactor of the message handling system was completed, moving from event-based emissions to direct function calls to improve traceability. A critical bug causing crashes related to Telegram button handling was resolved, and core stability was further improved by fixing build and logging system issues, notably by migrating to the `adze` logger for better compatibility with Bun's build process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this period centered on refactoring and bug fixes to create a more robust plugin.

- **Message Handling Refactor:** The plugin's message flow was made more traceable and easier to debug by refactoring it to use direct `runtime.handleMessage()` calls instead of event emissions. This change, implemented in PR [#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/17), primarily impacted `src/environment.ts` and `src/messageManager.ts`.

- **Stability and Bug Fixes:** A critical bug that caused crashes when handling Telegram buttons was fixed in PR [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/19). The solution involved safely converting buttons with added validation and fallbacks. This effort also included improvements to structured logging, expanded test coverage, and dependency updates to enhance overall stability.

- **New Work Initiated:** A new pull request, [#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/20), was opened to address an issue where GIF animations fail to play correctly within Telegram.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week focused on resolving core build system problems and clarifying existing functionality.

- **Closed Issues:**
    - **Core Build & Logging:** Two key issues affecting the build process were resolved. An error with `pino-pretty` in Bun export builds was fixed by migrating the logging system to `adze` ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5673)). A separate build failure in `@elizaos/core` was also fixed ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5738)).
    - **CLI Configuration:** An issue regarding optional API key setup during project creation was closed, as it was confirmed the `-y` flag already provides this functionality ([#5604](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5604)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
    - No new issues were opened during this period.
    - There were no active issues with significant discussion reported.
