# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Weekly Report (Jan 18 - 24, 2026)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week, development focused on hardening the plugin's integration with the broader ElizaOS ecosystem, specifically targeting compatibility with `@elizaos/core` version 1.7.x. Key achievements included a significant refactor of the messaging API to support unified communication standards and the implementation of structured logging to align with monorepo requirements. These updates collectively improve type safety, streamline CI/CD processes through new linting rules, and ensure the plugin remains resilient as the core framework evolves.

## 🛠️ Key Developments

### ElizaOS Core Compatibility & Type Safety
A primary focus this week was resolving technical debt and type mismatches arising from the transition to `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x. 
*   **Type Refinement:** Developers resolved TypeScript errors by removing deprecated `serverId` references from `ensureConnection` calls and implementing strict casting of `serverId` to `UUID` for Room and World objects.
*   **Payload Standardization:** Fixes were applied to custom event payload typing and `MessagePayload` usage to ensure seamless data flow between the plugin and the core framework ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).

### Infrastructure & Code Quality
To maintain high standards for open-source collaboration, the project introduced stricter linting and logging protocols.
*   **Structured Logging:** Standardized log formats were implemented across the repository to match the Eliza monorepo style.
*   **CI/CD Enhancements:** The team added ESLint rules specifically for structured logging and introduced a `lint:check` script to the CI pipeline to prevent regressions in code quality ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).

### Messaging API Refactor
The plugin's internal communication architecture was updated to improve modularity.
*   **Unified Messaging:** The messaging API underwent a refactor to implement a unified approach for ElizaOS support, streamlining how the plugin handles incoming and outgoing Telegram communications ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
*   **Closed Issues:** While no specific standalone issues were closed outside of PR resolutions, the week successfully addressed critical compatibility blockers related to the 1.7.x core update.
*   **New & Active Issues:** No new high-priority issues or community-reported bugs were recorded during this period, suggesting a stable transition following the recent refactors.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The activity this week reflects a concentrated effort by maintainers to synchronize the Telegram plugin with the rapid iteration of the ElizaOS core framework. The focus on structured logging and CI scripts indicates a shift toward long-term maintainability and easier onboarding for future contributors. Collaboration was centered on internal consistency, ensuring that the modular "plugin" architecture remains robust and type-safe within the decentralized intelligence ecosystem.
