## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61** ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031)): The issue, which reported missing imports like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` when using Eliza CLI 1.61, was closed today. The latest comments confirm that the type errors are resolved after a clean reinstall, and the core team member `wtfsayo` noted that this type of error can be due to node/package type resolution issues, with no specific fix made on their end. Previously, `claude` had provided a detailed root cause analysis, identifying the problem as missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, recommending users upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later.
