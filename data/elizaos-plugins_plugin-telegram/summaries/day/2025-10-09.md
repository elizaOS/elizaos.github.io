## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031)
The issue, which reported `Module '"@Elizaos/core"' has no exported member 'logger'` and similar errors, was closed today. The latest comments indicate that the type errors seem to be resolved after clean reinstalls of `node_modules` and fresh project creation. The user `matteo-brandolino` confirmed that the issue is no longer occurring. `wtfsayo` noted that this type of error can be due to node/package type resolution issues and that no specific fix was made on their end. Earlier discussions involved `claude` diagnosing the root cause as a build/publish pipeline issue in `@elizaos/core@1.6.1`, where TypeScript declaration files were missing or malformed, and recommended upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later. `0xbbjoker` had previously attempted to reproduce the issue without success and suggested verifying Node and Bun versions and performing clean installations.
