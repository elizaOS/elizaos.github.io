# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Daily Update (Jan 21, 2026)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing code quality and compatibility. Key achievements include implementing structured logging, resolving TypeScript errors for `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x, and refactoring the messaging API.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Logging and Code Quality
Structured logging has been implemented across the repository, standardizing log formats to align with the eliza monorepo. This includes the addition of ESLint with a structured logging rule and a `lint:check` script for CI, improving code quality and maintainability. ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21))

### TypeScript Compatibility and Type Safety
Resolved TypeScript errors to ensure compatibility with `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x. This involved removing deprecated `serverId` from `ensureConnection` calls, casting `serverId` to `UUID` for type safety in Room/World objects, and fixing custom event payload typing. ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24))

### Unified Messaging API
The messaging API has been refactored to implement a unified approach with elizaOS support, streamlining message handling within the plugin. ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22))
