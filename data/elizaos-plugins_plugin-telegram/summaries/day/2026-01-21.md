# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Daily Update (Jan 21, 2026)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing code quality and compatibility. Key achievements include implementing structured logging, resolving TypeScript errors for `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x, and refactoring the messaging API for unified ElizaOS support.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Logging and Code Quality
Structured logging has been implemented across the repository, standardizing log formats to align with the Eliza monorepo. This includes the addition of ESLint with a structured logging rule and a `lint:check` script for CI, improving code quality and maintainability ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).

### Improved ElizaOS Compatibility and Type Safety
TypeScript errors related to `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x compatibility have been resolved. This involved removing deprecated `serverId` from `ensureConnection` calls, casting `serverId` to `UUID` for type safety in Room/World objects, and fixing custom event payload typing and `MessagePayload` to use proper `Memory` ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).

### Unified Messaging API
The messaging API has been refactored to implement a unified approach with ElizaOS support, streamlining communication within the plugin ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).
