### Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031)
Discussion continued regarding the import errors when using `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1. The latest comment from @matteo-brandolino confirmed that the issue persists on Arch Linux, following up on a question from @wtfsayo about the operating system. Previously, @claude provided a detailed root cause analysis, identifying the problem as missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core@1.6.1` during its publication. The analysis concluded that the issue is version-specific and environment-independent, recommending users upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later and suggesting the ElizaOS team consider deprecating v1.6.1.
