### Investigation into `@elizaos/core` Import Errors ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031))
Discussion continued regarding an issue where imports from `@elizaos/core` were not found when using Eliza CLI 1.6.1. On October 8th, user @matteo-brandolino provided their OS as Arch Linux, in response to a query about their environment. This issue, initially reported on October 2nd, has seen multiple attempts at diagnosis, including a detailed analysis by Claude on October 7th, which suggested the problem was specific to version 1.6.1 due to missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in the published package. The latest comments on October 9th indicate that a clean reinstall resolved the issue for @matteo-brandolino, with @wtfsayo suggesting it might be due to node/package type resolution issues rather than a specific fix.
