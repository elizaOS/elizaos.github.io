# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Daily Update (Oct 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today saw significant progress in the Telegram plugin with a migration to direct message handling, critical bug fixes for button handling and logging, and the resolution of several long-standing issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Message Handling and Debuggability
The Telegram plugin's message handling mechanism was refactored to use direct `runtime.handleMessage()` calls instead of event-based emissions. This change aims to improve the traceability and debuggability of message flows within the plugin. ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/17))

### Robust Button Handling and Improved Logging
A critical fix was implemented to resolve crashes related to Telegram button handling. This involved safely converting Telegram buttons with validation and fallbacks. Additionally, structured logging was improved, and test coverage was expanded to ensure stability. ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/19))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/20): This pull request addresses an issue where GIF animations were not playing correctly in Telegram.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Core Build and Logging Compatibility Resolved
Two significant issues impacting the core build process and logging compatibility were closed today. The `pino-pretty` errors in export builds from Bun were resolved by migrating the logger to Adze, ensuring compatibility with Bun's binary compilation. ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5673)). Additionally, a build failure in `@elizaos/core` that caused `bun run clean` to fail due to TypeScript errors was fixed. ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5738)).

### API Key Setup Streamlined
The issue regarding making API key setup optional in `npx elizaos create` was closed, with confirmation that it is already optional when using the `-y` flag. ([#5604](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5604))
