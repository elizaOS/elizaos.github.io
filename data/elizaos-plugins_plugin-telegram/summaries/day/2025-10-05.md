### Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61
Discussion continued on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031), concerning import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61. On October 5th, `matteo-brandolino` suggested that the problem might stem from type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically `dist/index.d.ts` and `dist/types/index.d.ts`, which appear to reference non-existent source files. This could explain why TypeScript fails to find imports like `logger`, `Project`, or `IAgentRuntime`. They noted that downgrading to version 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the issue, suggesting a bug specific to version 1.6.1. Previously, on October 3rd, `0xbbjoker` confirmed that the issue did not reproduce on their end with 1.6.1 and requested `matteo-brandolino` to provide detailed steps or try a clean rebuild. `matteo-brandolino` clarified that it was a new project created with `elizaos create` and that the project runs correctly, but the type-related errors persist in their IDE.
