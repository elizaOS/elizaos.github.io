## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.6.1
Discussion continued on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031), which reports import errors in `index.ts` when creating a new project with `elizaos create` using Eliza CLI 1.6.1. The latest comment from matteo-brandolino suggests the issue might stem from missing source files referenced in the type definition files of the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically in version 1.6.1. Downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 reportedly resolves the problem.
