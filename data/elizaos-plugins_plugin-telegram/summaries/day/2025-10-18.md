# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Daily Update (Oct 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on reviewing and closing several issues related to pipeline enhancements, with a new issue opened regarding image sending in the Telegram plugin.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
- No new features, bug fixes, or code refactoring were completed today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Pipeline Rate Limiting and Cost Estimation
The issue regarding API cost estimation for the ingestion pipeline was closed as redundant. The existing GitHub client already incorporates sophisticated rate limiting mechanisms, including a token bucket system and automatic throttling, which effectively prevent rate limit exhaustion and handle secondary rate limits. The proposed estimation would duplicate existing functionality and potentially create unnecessary user anxiety. ([#156](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/156))

### Graceful Shutdown for CLI Pipeline
An enhancement request for adding graceful shutdown to the CLI pipeline was closed. It was determined that the pipeline already handles interruptions gracefully by continuously saving progress to the SQLite database and allowing for seamless resumption of processing from where it left off. The proposed changes were deemed to be a UX polish rather than a functional improvement, violating the YAGNI principle. ([#155](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/155))

## NEW ISSUES
### Image Sending with Hidden URLs
A new issue was opened concerning the inability to send images without also rendering the URI for the user. A potential fix was suggested: using `sendMessage` with `link_preview_options.url` set to the actual URL while omitting the URL from the text, which should allow Telegram to generate a preview without displaying the raw link. ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/18))
