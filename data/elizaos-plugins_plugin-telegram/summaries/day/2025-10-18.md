# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Daily Update (Oct 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on reviewing and closing several issues related to pipeline enhancements, with a new issue opened regarding image sending functionality.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
- No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, tests added, or other work were completed today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Pipeline Rate Limit Management
The issue regarding API cost estimation for the ingestion pipeline was closed as redundant. The existing GitHub client already incorporates a sophisticated token bucket system and automatic throttling to prevent rate limit exhaustion, making additional estimation unnecessary. [#156](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/156)

### Graceful Pipeline Shutdown
An enhancement request for graceful shutdown in the CLI pipeline was closed. It was determined that the pipeline already handles interruptions gracefully by continuously saving progress to the SQLite database and allowing for built-in resumption of processing. [#155](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/155)

## NEW ISSUES
### Image Sending Functionality
A new issue was opened concerning the inability to send images without also rendering the URI for the user. A potential fix suggests using `sendMessage` with `link_preview_options.url` to hide the URL while still generating a preview. [#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/18)
