      "title": "Bug: Plugin crashes with TypeError in processImage when handling native photo uploads",
      "author": "GarrickBrown",
      "number": 23,
      "repository": "elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram",
      "body": "### **Issue Report for `elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram`**\n\n**1. Describe the bug**\nThe `@elizaos/plugin-telegram` crashes when a user uploads an image \"as a photo\" via the Telegram client (as opposed to sending it \"as a file\"). The internal `processImage` function within the plugin's `messageManager.ts` calls `runtime.useModel(ModelType.IMAGE_DESCRIPTION, ...)` with incorrect parameters. It passes a raw string (`imageUrl`) as the second argument, but the `useModel` function for `IMAGE_DESCRIPTION` expects an object (`ImageDescriptionParams`). This results in a `TypeError: paramsObj is not an Object.` which halts all further message processing.\n\n**2. To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1.  Set up an ElizaOS project with `@elizaos/plugin-telegram`.\n2.  Ensure a model provider that can handle `ModelType.IMAGE_DESCRIPTION` is configured (e.g., `@elizaos/plugin-google-genai` with `GOOGLE_IMAGE_MODEL` set).\n3.  Start the ElizaOS server (`elizaos dev`).\n4.  In a Telegram chat with the bot, send an image by selecting it as a \"Photo\" (using the compressed/gallery option), not as a \"File\".\n5.  Observe the server logs. The application will throw a `TypeError` and likely fail to respond to the message.\n\n**3. Expected behavior**\nThe `processImage` function should not crash. It should successfully call `runtime.useModel` with the correct parameters, receive an image description, and create a valid `attachment` object that can be passed to the main message processing pipeline.\n\n**4. Logs**\nHere is the relevant stack trace from the crash:\n```\n❌ Error processing image: TypeError: paramsObj is not an Object. (evaluating '\"prompt\" in paramsObj')\n      at useModel (.../node_modules/@elizaos/core/dist/node/index.node.js:48866:53)\n      at processImage (.../node_modules/@elizaos/plugin-telegram/dist/index.js:207:59)\n      at async processMessage (.../node_modules/@elizaos/plugin-telegram/dist/index.js:431:36)\n      ...```\n\n**5. Suggested Fix**\nThe call to `useModel` inside the `processImage` function in `plugin-telegram/src/messageManager.ts` needs to be updated to match the expected `ImageDescriptionParams` interface.\n\nThe current implementation is:\n```typescript\nconst { title, description } = await this.runtime.useModel(\n  ModelType.IMAGE_DESCRIPTION,\n  imageUrl\n);\n```\nThis should be changed to pass an object, and it should also include the user's caption as the prompt for better contextual analysis:\n```typescript\nconst { title, description } = await this.runtime.useModel(\n  ModelType.IMAGE_DESCRIPTION,\n  { \n    imageUrl: imageUrl,\n    prompt: message.caption || \"Describe this image.\" \n  }\n);\n```\n\nThis change aligns the function call with the core `@elizaos/core` type definitions and resolves the `TypeError`.",
