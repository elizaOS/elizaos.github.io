      "body": "# Fix: GIF animations not playing in Telegram\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nGIF attachments are being sent as static images instead of animations in Telegram messages.\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\nThe `sendMessageInChunks` method uses a `typeMap` with prefix matching that can match GIFs to the generic `'image'` prefix before checking the specific `'image/gif'` prefix, depending on JavaScript object iteration order. This causes GIFs to be sent via `sendMedia()` with `MediaType.PHOTO` instead of `MediaType.ANIMATION`.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// Original buggy code\r\nconst typeMap = {\r\n  'image/gif': MediaType.ANIMATION,\r\n  image: MediaType.PHOTO,  // ← Matches 'image/gif'.startsWith('image')\r\n  ...\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n- Add explicit GIF detection before generic image handling\r\n- Use `ctx.replyWithAnimation()` directly for GIFs to preserve animation\r\n- Exclude `.gif` from the `isImage` regex pattern\r\n- Improve media routing with explicit type checks and proper fallbacks\r\n- Fix async anti-pattern: replace `.map(async)` with `for await` loop\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- ✅ Separate `isGif` check before `isImage` \r\n- ✅ Use Telegram's `replyWithAnimation()` for GIFs\r\n- ✅ Add fallback handling for failed GIF/video sends\r\n- ✅ Modernize attachment handling with direct Telegram API methods\r\n- ✅ Remove unreliable prefix-based type mapping for images/videos\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Tested with live Telegram bot sending GIF cards\r\n- Verified GIFs now animate correctly instead of showing as static images\r\n- Build passes successfully\r\n- TypeScript compilation successful\r\n\r\n## Risk Assessment\r\n**LOW RISK** - This is a targeted fix that:\r\n- Only affects attachment handling flow\r\n- Adds explicit checks without removing existing fallbacks\r\n- Improves code reliability with defensive programming\r\n- Doesn't change API surface or break existing functionality\r\n\r\n## Related\r\nFixes the issue where content with `contentType: 'image/gif'` attachments are displayed as static images in Telegram clients.\r\n\r\n\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n* **Bug Fixes**\n  * Enhanced attachment handling with improved fallback logic for media types (videos, GIFs, and images)\n  * Improved robustness in message processing and chat handling\n  * Better error logging and messaging consistency\n\n* **Style**\n  * Code formatting standardization\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",
