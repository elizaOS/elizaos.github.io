### Investigation into `@elizaos/core` Import Errors
Discussion continued on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6031), which reports "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61". User matteo-brandolino provided their OS as Arch Linux and shared the output of `bun x tsc --noEmit`, which showed numerous `TS2305` errors indicating missing exported members from `@elizaos/core`. These errors included `logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, `Project`, `ProjectAgent`, `Character`, `UUID`, `Plugin`, `Action`, `ActionResult`, `Content`, `GenerateTextParams`, `HandlerCallback`, `Memory`, `ModelType`, `Provider`, `ProviderResult`, and `Service`. Additionally, `TS2339` and `TS7006` errors were reported in `src/plugin.ts`. This detailed output further clarifies the scope of the import problem.
