### Investigation into `@elizaos/core` Import Errors [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6031)
Discussion continued regarding the "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61" issue. The latest comment from @matteo-brandolino confirmed that the user is on Arch Linux, following up on a previous query about the operating system. Earlier, @claude provided a detailed root cause analysis, concluding that `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1 was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files, causing exports like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` to be unavailable. The analysis suggested that the issue is specific to version 1.6.1 and is environment-independent, recommending users upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later. @0xbbjoker had previously attempted to reproduce the issue without success and requested system details from @matteo-brandolino to further investigate.
