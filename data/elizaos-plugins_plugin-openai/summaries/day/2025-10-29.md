# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai Daily Update (Oct 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the `plugin-openai` repository saw significant architectural improvements, refactoring a monolithic file into a modular structure, alongside a crucial bug fix for tokenization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Architectural Refactoring for Modularity
The OpenAI plugin underwent a major refactoring, transforming a single 1,253-line file into a well-organized modular architecture. This restructuring aligns with the established `plugin-openrouter` pattern, splitting the monolithic `index.ts` into focused modules based on responsibility. This change impacts various core components including models, utilities, and providers. ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/19))

### Tokenization Utility Bug Fix
A TypeScript type error in the tokenization utility was resolved. The fix ensures correct tokenization fallback by utilizing `getEncoding` with `TiktokenEncoding`, and the version has been bumped to 1.5.18. ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/20))
