# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai Daily Update (Oct 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a significant refactoring of the OpenAI plugin into a modular architecture, alongside a crucial bug fix for tokenization utility.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Modular Architecture Refactor
The OpenAI plugin underwent a major refactoring, transforming a monolithic 1,253-line file into a well-organized modular structure. This change aligns the plugin with the established `plugin-openrouter` pattern, splitting responsibilities into focused modules for improved maintainability and scalability. ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/19))

### Tokenization Utility Fix
A TypeScript type error in the tokenization utility was resolved. The fix ensures correct tokenization fallback by utilizing `getEncoding` with `TiktokenEncoding` and bumps the version to 1.5.18. ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/20))
