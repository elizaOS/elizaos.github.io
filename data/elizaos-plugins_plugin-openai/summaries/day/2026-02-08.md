# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai Daily Update (Feb 8, 2026)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the `elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai` repository saw significant progress with the introduction of persistent, database-backed caching for audio and image handlers, aiming to reduce redundant OpenAI calls and improve latency.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Caching for OpenAI API Calls
A major feature was implemented to introduce persistent, database-backed caching for OpenAI API calls. This enhancement aims to significantly reduce duplicate calls and improve latency, particularly for audio transcriptions and image descriptions.
- Implemented content-based cache keys for `audio.ts` `handleTranscription` using slice-hashed blobs and parameters, ensuring efficient caching of audio data.
- Added caching mechanisms to `image.ts` for image descriptions.
- Updated `package.json` to reflect changes related to the new caching functionality.
- This work is detailed in [#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/23).
