## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Module Import Resolution with Eliza CLI 1.6.1
Discussion continued on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6031) regarding `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61`. The latest comment from matteo-brandolino suggests the problem might stem from missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing source files that are not included in the published package. It was noted that downgrading to version 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the issue, indicating a potential bug specific to `@Elizaos/core` version 1.6.1.
