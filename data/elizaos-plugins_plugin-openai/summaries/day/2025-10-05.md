### Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61
Discussions continued on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6031) regarding import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61.
- **matteo-brandolino** suggested on October 5th that the issue might stem from missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing source files that may not be included in the published package. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem, suggesting a potential bug specific to version 1.6.1.
- **0xbbjoker** previously suggested running `bun x tsc --noEmit` to diagnose the issue, indicating it might be an IDE TSC compiler problem as they could not reproduce it with a fresh installation.
