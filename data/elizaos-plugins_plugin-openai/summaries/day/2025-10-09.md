## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6031))
The discussion on this issue concluded with the identification of the root cause: `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1 was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. The issue was confirmed to be version-specific and environment-independent. A user, matteo-brandolino, reported that a clean reinstall resolved the type errors, suggesting that the problem was indeed with the package itself rather than their local setup. wtfsayo confirmed that no specific fix was made on their end, attributing the resolution to node/package type resolution issues. Recommendations include upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later, considering deprecating v1.6.1, and adding publish-time validation to prevent future occurrences.
