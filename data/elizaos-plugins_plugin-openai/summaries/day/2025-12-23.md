# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai Daily Update (Dec 23, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the `plugin-openai` repository saw the addition of streaming support for text generation, a significant feature enhancement. This update also included new tests to ensure stability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Text Generation with Streaming Support
Streaming support for text generation was added, allowing for real-time output delivery as content is produced. This feature is dependent on a merge in the main ElizaOS repository. ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21))

### Core Module Updates
Several core modules, including `src/models` and `src/utils`, were updated as part of the streaming support implementation. This involved changes to `bun.lock`, `package.json`, `src/index.ts`, `src/models/text.ts`, `src/models/audio.ts`, `src/models/image.ts`, `src/models/object.ts`, `src/utils/config.ts`, and `src/utils/events.ts`. ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21))
