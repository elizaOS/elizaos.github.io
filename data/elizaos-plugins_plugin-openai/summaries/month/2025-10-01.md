# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai Monthly Report (October 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
October's development efforts focused on foundational infrastructure and critical bug investigation. Work began on automating dependency management to improve long-term project health and security by introducing Renovate. Concurrently, significant effort was dedicated to diagnosing a high-priority import resolution issue affecting users of a specific Eliza CLI version, with community collaboration pointing towards a potential root cause in the core framework.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This month's work centered on improving the project's maintenance and stability.

- **Dependency Management Automation**
  To streamline the process of keeping dependencies current and secure, a pull request ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/17)) was opened to integrate the Renovate automation tool into the repository. This initiative aims to reduce the manual overhead of dependency updates.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this month was focused on investigating an existing critical bug.

- **Closed Issues:**
  No issues were reported as closed based on the provided activity.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  No new issues were opened. However, discussion continued on the active issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6031), concerning "Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61". Investigation suggests the problem may be isolated to version 1.6.1 of `@Elizaos/core`, potentially due to missing type definition files in the published package. It was noted that downgrading or upgrading from this specific version serves as a temporary workaround.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
