# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's activity was centered on collaborative troubleshooting and proactive maintenance rather than new feature development. The primary focus was the diagnosis of a critical import error affecting users of Eliza CLI v1.6.1, tracked in issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6031). Through community discussion, the root cause was identified as malformed TypeScript declaration files in the upstream `@elizaos/core` package. While no new code was merged, a pull request was opened to introduce automated dependency management, aiming to prevent similar issues in the future.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
No new features, bug fixes, or refactoring were completed this week. Development activity was limited to proposing new tooling.

- **Dependency Automation:** A new pull request, [#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/17), was opened to add a Renovate configuration. This aims to automate the process of keeping project dependencies up-to-date.

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The week was dominated by the investigation of a single, high-impact active issue. No new issues were opened, and none were closed.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6031)):** Significant discussion occurred around this issue.
    - Contributor `matteo-brandolino` confirmed the bug on Arch Linux and suggested it was specific to `@Elizaos/core` v1.6.1, as other versions worked correctly.
    - A detailed root cause analysis from `claude` identified that version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core` was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files, making key exports like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` unavailable.
    - The recommended solution is for users to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or a later version. It was also suggested that the core team consider deprecating the faulty v1.6.1 from npm to prevent further impact.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was evident in the focused effort to resolve the import error in issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6031). Multiple community members, including `matteo-brandolino`, `0xbbjoker`, and `claude`, contributed to the diagnosis by sharing environment details, suggesting diagnostic commands, and providing a definitive root cause analysis. This highlights a healthy, community-driven approach to troubleshooting, even when the problem originates in an upstream dependency.
