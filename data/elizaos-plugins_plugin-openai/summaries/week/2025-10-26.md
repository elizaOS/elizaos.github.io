# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts were centered on significant architectural improvements and stabilization within the `plugin-openai` repository. The primary achievement was a major refactoring of the plugin's core logic, moving from a monolithic file to a modular structure to enhance long-term maintainability and scalability. This foundational work was complemented by a critical bug fix in the tokenization utility, ensuring correct type handling and reliable token counting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments

### Architectural Refactoring
To align with the project's philosophy of modularity, the plugin underwent a substantial refactoring. A single, 1,253-line `index.ts` file was broken down into a more organized, modular architecture, mirroring the pattern established in `plugin-openrouter`. This effort, completed in PR [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/19), splits responsibilities into focused modules, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

### Bug Fixes
A key bug fix resolved a TypeScript type error within the tokenization utility. The fix in PR [#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/20) ensures the correct fallback mechanism for tokenization by properly utilizing `getEncoding` with `TiktokenEncoding`. As part of this resolution, the package version was bumped to 1.5.18.
