The implementation includes:\n\n**Audio transcriptions (`audio.ts`)**:\n- Content-based caching using SHA-256 hashing (with fallback) to identify duplicate audio regardless of URL\n- Reads audio buffer once for both cache check and API call to avoid redundant I/O\n- Best-effort caching that doesn't block requests on cache failures\n\n**Image descriptions (`image.ts`)**:\n- URL-based caching for default prompts only (custom prompts bypass cache)\n- Image size validation via HEAD request to fail fast on oversized images (>20MB)\n- Support for newer model token parameters (`max_completion_tokens` for gpt-5/o1/o3 series)\n- Enhanced error handling with detailed error response logging\n\nBoth handlers follow a consistent pattern: check cache first, log appropriately, make API call if needed, cache successful results. The caching is designed to be non-intrusive with comprehensive logging for debugging.\n\n<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>\n\n\n- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk - well-designed caching implementation with proper error handling\n- Score reflects solid architecture and error handling, but there's a minor cache collision risk in image.ts where different images at the same URL could be cached incorrectly if image content changes without URL change\n- Pay attention to `src/models/image.ts` - the URL-based caching could cause issues if image content at a URL changes without the URL changing\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| src/models/audio.ts | Added content-based caching for transcriptions with robust SHA-256 hashing and fallback. Well-designed with proper error handling and detailed documentation. |\n| src/models/image.ts | Added URL-based caching, size validation, improved error handling, and max_completion_tokens support for newer models. Minor cache collision risk with URL-only keys. |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Client\n    participant Handler as Audio/Image Handler\n    participant Cache as Database Cache\n    participant OpenAI as OpenAI API\n\n    Client->>Handler: Request transcription/description\n    Handler->>Handler: Prepare media (hash audio/extract URL)\n    Handler->>Cache: Check cache with key\n    alt Cache HIT\n        Cache-->>Handler: Return cached result\n        Handler-->>Client: Return result (fast path)\n    else Cache MISS\n        Cache-->>Handler: No cached result\n        Handler->>OpenAI: API request with media\n        OpenAI-->>Handler: API response\n        Handler->>Cache: Store result (best-effort)\n        alt Cache write succeeds\n            Cache-->>Handler: Write confirmed\n        else Cache write fails\n            Cache-->>Handler: Write failed (logged, non-blocking)\n        end\n        Handler-->>Client: Return result\n    end\n```\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
