      "body": "… types\r\n\r\nAdd rate-limiter utility with per-endpoint backoff and retry logic. Improve embedding handler with better error handling and fallback support. Refactor init, audio, image, object, and text model handlers for @elizaos/core API compatibility. Expand types and add banner. Update README with comprehensive documentation.\n\n<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\n---\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **Medium Risk**\n> Touches all OpenAI model call paths and introduces new retry/throttling and 429 classification logic, which could impact latency and error handling behavior under load. Startup behavior and TypeScript typing are also changed, but mostly in a controlled, additive way.\n> \n> **Overview**\n> Adds a new process-wide rate limiter (`withRateLimit`/`acquireRateLimit`) with per-category sliding-window throttling, exponential backoff using `Retry-After`, one-shot tier logging, and **fail-fast billing/quota 429 detection** via `QuotaExceededError`.\n> \n> Updates embeddings/images/audio/object/text handlers to use the limiter and to `await throwIfRateLimited()` for typed 429 handling; embeddings also gain synthetic fast-paths (null/empty/`\"test\"`) to avoid startup probe API calls and return fallback vectors on dimension mismatch.\n> \n> Changes plugin init to be non-blocking and purely synchronous (removes eager `GET /models` validation), adds a startup config banner (`src/banner.ts`), introduces local core-compat streaming shims (`StreamingTextParams`/`TextStreamResult`), DRYs model registration with a `Plugin[\"models\"]` type assertion, switches `@elizaos/core` dependency to `workspace:*`, and expands docs with a new `CHANGELOG.md` and README sections for banner/rate limiting/compatibility.\n> \n> <sup>Written by [Cursor Bugbot](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot) for commit 7542c671110256a1e1b24627b90870f414fd9b92.

One minor bug in `retry-after` header parsing that could pass NaN to backoff logic. All other code is well-structured with proper error handling, caching strategies, and type safety\n- Pay attention to `src/utils/rate-limiter.ts:338` - the retry-after header parsing needs the parentheses fix to handle invalid header values correctly\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| src/utils/rate-limiter.ts | New rate limiter with sliding window, exponential backoff, and per-category tracking. Well-documented implementation with quota detection. |\n| src/models/embedding.ts | Enhanced with rate limiting and improved error handling. Synthetic embeddings for test probes avoid unnecessary API calls. |\n| src/models/image.ts | Added rate limiting, caching with content-aware keys, and size validation. Comprehensive error handling for image operations. |\n| src/models/text.ts | Refactored to use rate limiter with different strategies for streaming vs non-streaming calls. Clean implementation. |\n| src/models/audio.ts | Added transcription caching with content-based hashing and rate limiting. Efficient blob sampling for cache keys. |\n| src/init.ts | Removed eager API validation to avoid startup race conditions. Synchronous config validation only. |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Flowchart</h3>\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    Start[API Call Request] --> CheckCategory{Determine Category<br/>chat/embeddings/images/audio}\n    CheckCategory --> AcquireSlot[Acquire Rate Limit Slot]\n    \n    AcquireSlot --> CheckBackoff{Active Backoff?}\n    CheckBackoff -->|Yes| WaitBackoff[Wait for Backoff]\n    CheckBackoff -->|No| CheckWindow{Within RPM Limit?}\n    \n    WaitBackoff --> CheckWindow\n    CheckWindow -->|No| WaitWindow[Wait for Window Slot]\n    CheckWindow -->|Yes| RecordRequest[Record Request Timestamp]\n    \n    WaitWindow --> RecordRequest\n    RecordRequest --> MakeCall[Execute API Call]\n    \n    MakeCall --> CheckResponse{Response Status}\n    CheckResponse -->|200 OK| Success[Return Result]\n    CheckResponse -->|429 Quota| QuotaError[Throw QuotaExceededError<br/>No Retry]\n    CheckResponse -->|429 Rate Limit| RateError{Retries Left?}\n    CheckResponse -->|Other Error| OtherError[Throw Error]\n    \n    RateError -->|Yes| RecordBackoff[Record Backoff Deadline<br/>Exponential + Jitter]\n    RateError -->|No| MaxRetries[Throw Max Retries Error]\n    \n    RecordBackoff --> Sleep[Sleep with Backoff]\n    Sleep --> AcquireSlot\n    \n    Success --> End[Complete]\n    QuotaError --> End\n    OtherError --> End\n    MaxRetries --> End\n```\n\n<sub>Last reviewed commit: 7542c67</sub>\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
