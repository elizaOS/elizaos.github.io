      "body": "Refactored the OpenAI plugin from a single 1,253-line file into a well-organized\r\nmodular structure following the established plugin-openrouter pattern.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Split monolithic index.ts into focused modules by responsibility\r\n- Created types/ directory for all type definitions\r\n- Created utils/ directory (config, events, audio, json, tokenization)\r\n- Created providers/ directory for OpenAI client instantiation\r\n- Created models/ directory with handlers for each model type\r\n  - text.ts: TEXT_SMALL & TEXT_LARGE handlers\r\n  - embedding.ts: TEXT_EMBEDDING handler\r\n  - image.ts: IMAGE & IMAGE_DESCRIPTION handlers\r\n  - audio.ts: TRANSCRIPTION & TEXT_TO_SPEECH handlers\r\n  - object.ts: OBJECT_SMALL & OBJECT_LARGE handlers\r\n  - tokenizer.ts: tokenizer encode/decode handlers\r\n- Created init.ts for plugin initialization logic\r\n- Moved tests to __tests__/ directory\r\n- Main index.ts reduced from 1,253 to 311 lines\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n- Improved maintainability with 20-200 line files\r\n- Consistent structure across LLM provider plugins\r\n- Better code organization and separation of concerns\r\n- No breaking changes - full backward compatibility maintained\n\n<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\n---\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Restructures the OpenAI plugin from a monolith to a modular architecture with dedicated model handlers, shared utilities, a provider client, background init validation, and a comprehensive test suite.\n> \n> - **Structure**:\n>   - Split `src/index.ts` into focused modules: `models/` (text, embedding, image, audio, object, tokenizer), `utils/` (config, events, audio, json, tokenization), `providers/` (`openai` client), `types/`, and `init.ts`.\n>   - `src/index.ts` now wires model routes to handler functions and invokes `initializeOpenAI`.\n>   - Re-export public APIs from `src/models/index.ts`, `src/providers/index.ts`, and `src/utils/index.ts`.\n> - **Functionality**:\n>   - Centralized config/helpers (`getBaseURL`, `getAuthHeader`, model selectors, telemetry flag) and event emission.\n>   - Extracted handlers for `TEXT_SMALL`, `TEXT_LARGE`, `TEXT_EMBEDDING`, `IMAGE`, `IMAGE_DESCRIPTION`, `TRANSCRIPTION`, `TEXT_TO_SPEECH`, and tokenizer encode/decode.\n>   - Provider setup via `createOpenAIClient`; background API key validation in `initializeOpenAI`.\n> - **Tests & Env**:\n>   - Added `__tests__/plugin.test.ts` covering all model handlers and tokenization; `__tests__/setup.ts`.\n>   - Added `.env.test` template; updated `.gitignore` to exclude env and test artifacts.\n> \n> <sup>Written by [Cursor Bugbot](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot) for commit e2b956111fd26d40b45f1965602a2ebb724dd617.
