Startup behavior and TypeScript typing are also changed, but mostly in a controlled, additive way.\n> \n> **Overview**\n> Adds a new process-wide rate limiter (`withRateLimit`/`acquireRateLimit`) with per-category sliding-window throttling, exponential backoff using `Retry-After`, one-shot tier logging, and **fail-fast billing/quota 429 detection** via `QuotaExceededError`.\n> \n> Updates embeddings/images/audio/object/text handlers to use the limiter and to `await throwIfRateLimited()` for typed 429 handling; embeddings also gain synthetic fast-paths (null/empty/`\"test\"`) to avoid startup probe API calls and return fallback vectors on dimension mismatch.\n> \n> Changes plugin init to be non-blocking and purely synchronous (removes eager `GET /models` validation), adds a startup config banner (`src/banner.ts`), introduces local core-compat streaming shims (`StreamingTextParams`/`TextStreamResult`), DRYs model registration with a `Plugin[\"models\"]` type assertion, switches `@elizaos/core` dependency to `workspace:*`, and expands docs with a new `CHANGELOG.md` and README sections for banner/rate limiting/compatibility.\n> \n> <sup>Written by [Cursor Bugbot](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot) for commit 7542c671110256a1e1b24627b90870f414fd9b92.

One minor bug in `retry-after` header parsing that could pass NaN to backoff logic. All other code is well-structured with proper error handling, caching strategies, and type safety\n- Pay attention to `src/utils/rate-limiter.ts:338` - the retry-after header parsing needs the parentheses fix to handle invalid header values correctly\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| src/utils/rate-limiter.ts | New rate limiter with sliding window, exponential backoff, and per-category tracking. Well-documented implementation with quota detection. |\n| src/models/embedding.ts | Enhanced with rate limiting and improved error handling. Synthetic embeddings for test probes avoid unnecessary API calls. |\n| src/models/image.ts | Added rate limiting, caching with content-aware keys, and size validation. Comprehensive error handling for image operations. |\n| src/models/text.ts | Refactored to use rate limiter with different strategies for streaming vs non-streaming calls.

The implementation includes:\n\n**Audio transcriptions (`audio.ts`)**:\n- Content-based caching using SHA-256 hashing (with fallback) to identify duplicate audio regardless of URL\n- Reads audio buffer once for both cache check and API call to avoid redundant I/O\n- Best-effort caching that doesn't block requests on cache failures\n\n**Image descriptions (`image.ts`)**:\n- URL-based caching for default prompts only (custom prompts bypass cache)\n- Image size validation via HEAD request to fail fast on oversized images (>20MB)\n- Support for newer model token parameters (`max_completion_tokens` for gpt-5/o1/o3 series)\n- Enhanced error handling with detailed error response logging\n\nBoth handlers follow a consistent pattern: check cache first, log appropriately, make API call if needed, cache successful results. The caching is designed to be non-intrusive with comprehensive logging for debugging.\n\n<h3>Confidence Score: 4/5</h3>\n\n\n- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk - well-designed caching implementation with proper error handling\n- Score reflects solid architecture and error handling, but there's a minor cache collision risk in image.ts where different images at the same URL could be cached incorrectly if image content changes without URL change\n- Pay attention to `src/models/image.ts` - the URL-based caching could cause issues if image content at a URL changes without the URL changing\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| src/models/audio.ts | Added content-based caching for transcriptions with robust SHA-256 hashing and fallback. Well-designed with proper error handling and detailed documentation. |\n| src/models/image.ts | Added URL-based caching, size validation, improved error handling, and max_completion_tokens support for newer models.
